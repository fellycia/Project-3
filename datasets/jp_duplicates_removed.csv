Welcome to the [r/japan](https://new.reddit.com/r/japan/) Basic Question Thread.

If you want to post:

* A basic identification question (who/what/where is this thing/person/place/food/etc?)
* A question that could be asked in its entirety in a post title (where can I buy X?)
* A question you probably could have just Googled but want a minor amount of karma for
* Any question where the first thing you'd write is ""this is probably dumb but""

Then you should be posting in this thread.

Questions we don't allow:

* Anything related to using proxy shippers/personal shoppers (we are not technical support, we are not going to stand in line for your only-in-Tokyo sneakers)
* How to pirate Japanese content
* ""What does Japan think about X?"" (Answer: Japan is not a monolith and very few of the users in this sub are Japanese)
* ""Is X like it is in anime?"" (Answer: Anime is not real life)

japan,"Anime has a ton of, let's say, ""fan service."" I've had friends who gave it a shot and concluded that Japanese society must be more risque compared to the US based on how the cartoons are. However, upon talking to some Japanese folks I learned that anime is not very mainstream in Japan (aside from a few big name ones like Neon Genesis and Demon Slayer, as well as content geared towards children, such as Doraemon, Pokemon, Ghibli, etc). If that was incorrect someone please let me know. However, I'm wondering if it is indeed true that anime is more of a niche interest in Japan than mainstream, does that mean Japanese live action television and movies are not as sexually suggestive?

To clarify, I do not intend any shade thrown towards Japanese society here. American live movies and TV shows after all have gotten very risque in the 21st century (see Game of Thrones). If the answer is yes, I see it as more just what a society is accustomed to as opposed to any signaling of some sort of cultural flaw",Is Japanese Live Action Content More Tame Compared to Anime?,"Anime has a ton of, let's say, ""fan service.""

japan,"I'm making a silly comic about Japanese high school baseball and I realized I have no idea how to name the town the characters live in. I tried googling but can't find my specific questions.

Do towns in Japan follow the same naming convention as north America, where they are just named after pleasant sounding things? Or can they also just be the name of a person?

I also read that towns and villages have different designations but I'm not sure if that is just bureaucratic, or if it is a noticiable difference if a place is one or the other.

It is supposed to be a town(village??) from rural Osaka.

japan,"Yesterday I got a Pfizer vaccine shot via a cancellation waiting list, but before that I did some research on vaccine reservations at local clinics to try to figure out which places would be most likely to have lots of reservations and some vacancies. The info is no longer of use to me, but I figured it might be helpful for someone else.

In the weeks to come, more and more people under 64 are going to get coupons. As a result, many clinics will re-open reservations for a new wave of patients. But Reservations for this summer are going to fill up fast when that tidal wave of new coupon-holders hits. The faster you can make a shortlist of clinics in your area that are likely to still have shots and get their websites bookmarked so you can be on top of updates, the better your chances of snagging a reservation spot before August and getting to enjoy at least a bit of your summer.

First, Try googling “キャンセル待ち” + your area and do a direct search for cancellation lists. At any given time, most websites will say they are overwhelmed with requests and have closed the list for the time being. Don’t be discouraged. Bookmark those websites and check each of them every morning. Eventually they will open up for a new round of reservations, and when they do you will be on top of it.

If that doesn't work, you will need to start calling clinics looking for open reservations; most don't even have online reservations, let alone online waiting lists. 

Make sure you start with the list of participating clinics on your ward's website. You can also track them down on yahoo maps by doing a search on ワクチン：

https://map.yahoo.co.jp/search?q=%E3%83%AF%E3%82%AF%E3%83%81%E3%83%B3&amp;lat=35.67861&amp;lon=139.76533&amp;zoom=14&amp;maptype=basic

If you're lucky you may have 200+ clinics in your area. Even if you were inclined to call them all until you got a reservation, by the time you found the right clinic they could already be booked. Here's how to target clinics most likely to have a spot for you first.

The situation on the ground:

Mostly, the main clientele at doctors offices is old people because they need the most medical attention. So they are not just the governments priority, they are the clinics priority too, because they represent the repeat business.

As a result, most of those clinics have booked appointments solid for old people well into the future. They have more regular elderly clients than they do reservation slots, and so their treasured elderly clients get all of them. You probably won’t be able to get a reservation at most typical clinics until late July at the earliest, maybe August or worse.

The other issue is that a lot of doctors are really busy with full waiting rooms every day anyway. Even if they are officially participating in the program they are not making it a priority and have not set aside that much time to do these vaccinations in the first place. My family knows a doctor in another ward who sees the clinic’s order forms for his area, and not all orders are equal, some order hundreds of shots per month, some just a few. My regular clinic is only doing vaccinations two Sundays per month, 30 people per day. For him it is just extra work to do on one of his days off and he seems to be putting in the minimum effort.

So, two things to look for when you go through the list of (hopefully) one or two hundred clinics in your area, looking for a rare still-open reservation in that haystack:

1) doctors that don’t have a lot of elderly patients

2) doctors that have small numbers of high profit patients, rather than large volumes of relatively low profit patients

A perfect place to find a reservation: a women’s fertility clinic. They are like a car dealership: high profits off the clients they have, but still lots of downtime where nobody is there. And there aren't a whole lot of old people using a fertility clinic. There are a few that are doing lots of vaccinations five days a week during their downtime. Another one we found that looks promising is mostly plastic surgery.

Since those are few and far between, a good fallback is pediatricians. Both their clients and clients’ parents are non-elderly. They have higher volumes of patients, but at the very least you can get a fresh start near the front of the waiting queue, rather than be told that an entire summer worth of reservations have already been taken up by elderly patients who had a head start of a couple months to book.

2) doctors that have small numbers of high profit patients, rather than large volumes of relatively low profit patients

A perfect place to find a reservation: a women’s fertility clinic. They are like a car dealership: high profits off the clients they have, but still lots of downtime where nobody is there. And there aren't a whole lot of old people using a fertility clinic. There are a few that are doing lots of vaccinations five days a week during their downtime. Another one we found that looks promising is mostly plastic surgery.

Since those are few and far between, a good fallback is pediatricians. Both their clients and clients’ parents are non-elderly. They have higher volumes of patients, but at the very least you can get a fresh start near the front of the waiting queue, rather than be told that an entire summer worth of reservations have already been taken up by elderly patients who had a head start of a couple months to book.

Good luck! Tips on how to find clinics in Japan that still have vaccine reservation spots"

japan,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

Im sorry if this question has come up before, but Ive tried researching and it has been hard to find any concrete information for some reason. Id like to get tested for STDs and STIs preventatively, as I dont have any symptoms and never had, but just for peace of mind my partner and I would like to get tested. All we have found is extremely high prices in clinics ranging from 6000 to 9000 yen per single test item and I find that hard to believe, since in my country it is free to get tested preventatively.

My question would be, are there ways to get tested here without spending upwards of 400-600 bucks? Has anyone had any experience with this before? Is there cheaper or other ways? I thought of maybe contacting the embassy but it seems kind of too much to bother them with this matter.

japan,"**EDIT:** Okay since there have been a lot of comments about it... no, Interac didn't actually tell me that they stole my cat... he's just missing and I assumed that they have stolen him since they told me to get rid of him! I can't think of anything else that could have happened.

I've been working in Japan as an English teacher for almost 5 years now. Currently, I'm employed by Interac, who takes care of my apartment (it's a Leopalace).

With the Coronavirus pandemic, I've been stuck inside pretty much 24/7. I begrudgingly go to work, but make sure to complain often to my JTE about how we shouldn't be here. Then it's straight home, and no outings, only take-out food, no visitors ect. Can't believe people are taking things so lightly...

Anyway, I could spend a whole another post ranting about COVID haha. The point of this post is I've been lonely at home all this time so I thought I would get a pet of some kind. My apartment has a strict no-pets policy and even after begging Interac to allow it, they still wouldn't budge!

So I said ""F U!"" (figuratively) and about three months ago bought a cat from a pet shop anyway (his name is Nyaanta). Everything was fine and dandy for a while, but about a month ago Nyaanta started getting REALLY loud whenever I left the apartment. One of my neighbors must have heard and complained to the apartment people because next thing you know I'm getting a call from Interac demanding that I get rid of my cat!!!

I of course told them no, and that there's nothing they can do about it. Well a couple days ago I come home from work to find Nyaanta GONE!! I was freaking out until I got a call from Interac telling me that they had confiscated him because it breaches my apartment contract.

Since they don't have pet shelters in Japan, I'm really worried that they are just going to let him loose on the street or something.

There is also some writing behind it in Japanese for directions on how/when to wear it and what it's supposed to do.

Any help would be amazing, thank you in advance. Bought a few Japanese zodiac keychains in Aomori city (in Misawa). I bought a wrong one and I'm looking for where I can find them without having to go all the way back"
japan,"Hi all, I’m not too sure where to ask about this and figured this thread is general enough, I hope I’m not violating any guidelines. 

I’ve got 13 months til my Japanese passport expires. For context, I am a dual citizen of the USA and Japan, born to a father and mother of those countries respectively. As a child my mother always had our passports renewed whenever we visited Japan while on vacation, never doing it abroad. 

I’m 22, the supposed age to “claim” or “renounce” citizenship. I’ve just also finished my undergrad career and intend on moving to the EU (Netherlands) with my partner in a month, just before my passport reaches &lt;1 year til expiration, as he obtains a masters while I find work. I’ll be needing to apply for a residence permit there as his unmarried partner, and we see no reason or potential possibility for denial. 

I’m not sure where/how to apply for a new Japanese passport, and whether applying for my Dutch residence permit with my Japanese passport is more beneficial than my US passport. I know the procedure for reapplication is fairly similar at all consulates and embassies, with the exception of providing ID for whichever current country of residence you’re in, and providing or not needing to provide koseki (the US embassy doesn’t require it as long as your passport is still valid at the moment of application, while it seems like the Dutch embassy requires koseki anyways). 

I fully intend on keeping both nationalities, because I know it’s never enforced and how problematic it would be for Japan if they began to do so. But any sort of advice on which passport to enter the EU with would be better, and which country to renew my passport at would be greatly appreciated!

If you could please help me by translating them, I know I could then reach out to the town halls of the town/prefecture listed and hope they will have a better idea. 

Thanks again and I appreciate the help!

Japan vaccination system troubled with recognition problem (Using OCR to read printed digits not barcode) so government of Japan are distributing tablet stand for easier recognition."

japan,"My girlfriend who is a Japanese national from osaka was just denied boarding on two flights back from Turkey (where we spent the last couple of months cause I myself, European, can not go back to Japan) despite having a perfectly fine throat &amp; nasal swab PCR. First flight with Emirates was because she didn't use the correct ""form"" which the hospital has to write down the test results (No joke!) and it gets even worse. So after being denied boarding, she did another PCR test at the airport, the doctor filling out the form for her, and today, now with Air France, she was denied boarding AGAIN. Because she not only has to use the ready-made form, she also has to do it as a designated hospital in Istanbul. She has now been spending 2,5 days at the airport, which is already quite a horror, and now her next flight is on third of may. She called the japanese consulate and embassy today to ask which hospital that designated hospital is--guess what: They didn't know. There is no information about this what so ever anywhere in Japanese about this (the form, yes, we managed to find that very well hidden information AFTER we got told by the Emirates-staff), let alone in English.

This has been a nightmare, my girlfriend was crying non stop for half an hour (I managed to get back home to Europe easily with a regular PCR test JUST AS IT SHOULD BE) and I hope this information will help anyone who is about to fly to Japan. You can ask me questions.

This is the information about the form (dated 28. April) [https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page25e\_000334.html](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page25e_000334.html)

The information about the designated hospital--well, we haven't found it yet. Only Air France told us she can't fly cause she has to do her PCR at THAT, and ONLY THAT, hospital (nobody at Air France knew exactly which, but they assumed it was the American Hospital). (At the embassy they told her a few Japanese citizens got turned down IN JAPAN because of not having had their PCR done in that hospital. Also, they didn't know exactly which hospital)

This is the most ridiculous chicanery I ever heard of, total kafkaesk and bordering to harrassment. It virtually doesn't make any difference which form a PCR result is written on.

EDIT: Thanks for all the support, it was really helpful. I found this information in the group posted by a redditor (thanks!), it's about all the details regarding the PCR [https://www.facebook.com/groups/returntojapan/permalink/1120455351785651/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/returntojapan/permalink/1120455351785651/) (Not sure if you need to join the group first, but it's up to date information) IMPORTANT: For everyone who's going to Japan, it is absolutely recommended to join this group and read this information. You'll find a list of countries and the clinics that offer the correct tests required by Japanese govt. Save yourself a lot of hassle, time and money. Good luck!

EDIT 2:  I found this really useful! Japan requires Nasopharyngeal swabs to enter. Some labs (as we found out) perform ""nasopharyngeal swabs"", but just write ""nasal swab"". Also, problems could arise if it's a combined throat &amp; nasal swab, which is also not allowed according to several sources. So please make sure and tell the lab in advance that they MUST write nasopharyngeal swab, and not just nasal swab.

japan,"Sorry for the depressing topic, but I just watched the Japanese movie ""Shoplifters"" which is really great and highly recommended.  Only problem is that the ending:

&gt;! is extremely depressing; an neglected and abused little girl is returned by the police to her abusive parents, even though she was missing for 2 weeks and the police knew the parents didn't even care enough to file a missing person's report!&lt;

I researched a little to see how exaggerated or accurate this movie was to real life, and found this very depressing article:[Why Japan Keeps Returning Abused Kids to their Parents Until They Are Killed](http://www.japansubculture.com/child-abuse-in-japan-why-japan-keeps-returning-abused-kids-to-their-parents-until-they-are-killed/).

It mentions that Japanese Child Protective Services (CPS) are very understaffed and undermanned. And there was a famous case in 2018 of a little girl suffering abuse until she died.  And that Japan unfortunately has more child abuse cases per capita than many other countries and even more CA cases in total than a larger country like the US (where CPS intervenes earlier).

The only positive in the article was that many people in the society were shocked and saddened by this case. So maybe things have gotten better in the past 2 years? Has the Japanese CPS gotten a bigger budget? Have the Japanese police and judiciary become more active in intervening and stopping CA?  (Another article says sentences for CA have gotten harsher since 2011, but it doesn't seem like much.)

I really hope someone who speaks Japanese or is up-to-date with Japanese news media can please update me on this situation. I love Japan and I really hope that the many Japanese people who care are working to make this situation better for abused Japanese children in the long-run.  Thanks very much.",Child abuse + CPS in Japan,"Sorry for the depressing topic, but I just watched the Japanese movie ""Shoplifters"" which is really great and highly recommended.

For those of you that know, Sukyo Mahikari is a religious organisation or cult depending on how you look at it.

I first noticed it on the coach to Takayama from Nagoya the last time I was in Japan, its kind of hard not to notice the MASSIVE golden roof on the temple building.

Anyway, I'm curious to hear what people know about the area or group, I've no intention of joining but from what I've read its rather benign.

Is the surrounding area made up of members or is it just a monolithic building that's sprung up around everyday folk?

I guess it was more of a shock to see such a thing in Japan but I guess such a thing can be anywhere, I mean Scientology has huge places in the UK after all.",Sukyo Mahikari in Takayama,"Hi all,

japan,"Well, as a disclaimer, I'm mixed (hafu) and brazilian, but I come from a japanese family, due to the south america japanese diaspora as you might know, and I believe that can be relevant to the discussion. I'm not talking about nationality, mostly about identity, and I'm aware I am not japanese, but japanese-brazilian.

My family came from the main island of Okinawa in 1934, and I know Okinawa used to be part of the Ryukyu Kingdom that existed prior to the Meiji era, and it was made a vassal by Satsuma clan in 1609 and then formally annexed as a prefecture of Japan in 1879. I believe you know the story.

Where I live there's a strong okinawan community, alongside a huge mainland japanese community which reunites people from many prefectures in one place, so I've been to matsuris that involved many prefectures together, also many neighbourhoods don't tend to have this distinction between *yamato* and *uchinaanchus.* In short, I've been raised among brazilian + yamato + uchinaanchu culture.

My grandmother speaks japanese, and although she understands okinawago (as she calls it), she can't speak it. She also doesn't cook typical okinawan food, but cooks kare, norimaki, onigiri, manju, etc. My family went to work in Japan for a couple of years and then returned. A couple of relatives still live in Mie prefecture, some moved recently to Brazil as well.

My question is, I see that much of Okinawan culture in the media is not what I'm used to, and I don't feel *that much Okinawan*, but at the same time I don't know if that's quite right, and I would like to know if someone else feels this way.

I understand Okinawa IS JAPAN, and Japan is not so homogenous as media generally portrays, but some people put so much emphasis in being Okinawan and not Japanese, not that there's anything wrong with that, absolutely not, but I don't feel the same way as they do, and **personally**, I feel more japanese than uchinaanchu per say, does anyone else feels like this? Am I doing something wrong?

In conslusion, I usually describe myself as japanese AND okinawan in background.

japan,"Hello! Most of the (english-written) sources about kudzu cloth say that it is a really robust and versatile material for clothing and for making other objects too (like baskets, maybe shoes, towels...). Then I just found out an article with a totally different opinion:
""Fabric made from kudzu, while extremely supple and shiny, is not very durable. For this reason it's use in Japan was mainly limited to the ceremonial costumes of samurai and a few religious garments. Occasionally it could be found in room dividers. In the mid-twentieth century kudzu fabric even found its way into commercial wallpaper. Extracting fiber from the vine is tremendously labor-intensive, labor that is performed only in the intense heat of summer; this may account for its lack of popularity. ""

A Japanese friend, let's call them A, lost one of their parents yesterday and I am writing to ask how to show support. 

Short background: A is a friend of the family but our relationship started off through employment - A does some housework at our house. A comes every day, tidies up handles laundry etc. We became close over time, we meet A's kid and our kids LOVE A. A's family is in Japan except for A's kids who live with A in the US. A's parent passed away yesterday, in Japan. A was very close to this parent. 

Question: Are there any Japanese mourning traditions we should be aware of or help with in anyway? Should we go over to A? or avoid going over? Is it customary to give space or is it OK to reach out every day to check in? Anything we can organize for A? We will get food for A for a few days so they don't need to deal with that and we said we'd pay for any days A wants to stay home. What else can we do?

japan,"Because of that Minami Minegishi thing, i've decided to read more on AKB48. Spent a week reading books and stories on them, and how they were made and how Japan sees them. And thus, it came to this conclusion:

AKB48 is a huge scam designed to fork out money from wotagei idiots who don't care about talent and that Yasushi Akimoto is the greatest scam artist after Deepak Chopra, Adam Sandler, Richard DeVos and L.Ron Hubbard.

Basically, Yasushi Akimoto took a bunch of talentless female hacks and combine them all to create the most talentless idol group ever created in order to get easy money from idiots in the cheapest way possible.

And combine it with the best delusional marketing campaign ever (""Idols you want to meet!"") and the money will keep rolling for ever.

And he's good with this. He has experience running an idol group with Onyanko Club. But this time, he does it with one target: Wotagei/idol otakus who don't care about talent or quality and are willing to fork out as much money as they could for the sake of their idols because they're too dense and too stupid to realize that the money mainly goes to Akimoto and not the idols.

And i can see Akimoto pitching the concept of AKB48 to Japan inc:

""Hi, i am Yasushi Akimoto. You might know me for creating Onyanko Club. But this time, i want to create a new idol group, and it doesn't require any talent whatsoever. We're gonna have lots of members more than Onyanko and Johnny's idols, and this will be very cheap because we don't give a fuck about talent and quality due to the fact that our main target audience will be idol otakus who would buy anything with cute looks over talent, and with that we will get rich and make loads of money from this idol group and from the idiots who buy and obsess over them. And let's not forget all the CMs and sponsors we can get!""

Seriously, it's genius. Is this like the greatest scam ever conceived in East Asia. Forking out money from morons by creating a talentless idol group led by hundreds of cute girls is great. Now, i might be wrong and i don't have the facts from Akimoto's head. But, a scam would perfectly describe AKB48 wouldn't it?

PS: Here's Red Letter Media's review of Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill which also describes how the movie was a huge pyramid scam (Hence the Sandler mention at the beginning): http://redlettermedia.com/half-in-the-bag/jack-and-jill/",Is AKB48 just a giant big scam to fork out money from clueless Japanese neckbeards?

And he's good with this. He has experience running an idol group with Onyanko Club. But this time, he does it with one target: Wotagei/idol otakus who don't care about talent or quality and are willing to fork out as much money as they could for the sake of their idols because they're too dense and too stupid to realize that the money mainly goes to Akimoto and not the idols.

And i can see Akimoto pitching the concept of AKB48 to Japan inc:

""Hi, i am Yasushi Akimoto. You might know me for creating Onyanko Club. But this time, i want to create a new idol group, and it doesn't require any talent whatsoever. We're gonna have lots of members more than Onyanko and Johnny's idols, and this will be very cheap because we don't give a fuck about talent and quality due to the fact that our main target audience will be idol otakus who would buy anything with cute looks over talent, and with that we will get rich and make loads of money from this idol group and from the idiots who buy and obsess over them. And let's not forget all the CMs and sponsors we can get!""

Seriously, it's genius. Is this like the greatest scam ever conceived in East Asia. Forking out money from morons by creating a talentless idol group led by hundreds of cute girls is great. Now, i might be wrong and i don't have the facts from Akimoto's head. But, a scam would perfectly describe AKB48 wouldn't it?

PS: Here's Red Letter Media's review of Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill which also describes how the movie was a huge pyramid scam (Hence the Sandler mention at the beginning): http://redlettermedia.com/half-in-the-bag/jack-and-jill/ Is AKB48 just a giant big scam to fork out money from clueless Japanese neckbeards? They're starting to look like Amway but with cute girls. And it's genius"

Am a 21 y.o male living in the netherlands that will go (through an exchange program) to Japan for 6 months. I don't have any connection with Japan and I never was really planning to go to Japan but I made a mistake in exchange program form :,), nevertheless after some talking with students and teachers I planned to go anyway. 
(I actually had no choice haha..)

So the first step ofcourse is to acquire some information about Japan/living in Japan/ culture and before i realised i got really interested and excited to go. I kept on looking for more info on this reddit page and it gave me some kind of image of what i can expected.

However tho, I believe in the islam and from what i have read is that drinking in Japan is extremely populair. I don't mind going into a bar with friends/students/colleagues, i don't mind that people are drinking and are having fun. Its just I do not want to come over as a twat that doesn't drink and be rude &gt;.&lt;. I have no idea how to avoid that. Also, I don't eat all kinds of meat (only if they are ""Slaughtered in an islamic way"") but fish is no problem.

Is that my biggest concern? No, islam has been covered a lot lately in the news and people are genuine afraid for it. I don't blame them after all the events and all the reports. I believe that these people that do these horrible act are hiding behind a faith.. Anyway after some research I found an article of islam in Japan which didn't really put my mind in ease. 

It stated:
""...Japan is known as a country with the least appreciation of Islam: Japan is the only country in the world that gives no citizenship to muslims and forbids for muslims to spread the Islam. The country has barely any embassies in Islamic countries and the vast majority of the Japanese population agree that Islam itself is a very narrow-minded religion...""

It's not that I am walking casually around the neighbourhood shouting: "" am a muslim! Be aware and respect me!"" Ofcourse not. It's just in the 6 month I probably will be put in a situation where I have to say: ""am sorry, am a muslim and i can't not eat/drink that."" Am afraid that they will instantly dislike me or worse :(.

Is there anyone with tips/advice or experience on what i can do? 

Thanks in advance :D!

",Abusing reality in Japan,"http://virates.com/society/1026010

I'm Japanese and I raise kids. Very sad and frustrating to say that this is not uncommon in Japan. Parents frequently starve or beat their children to death, and it's always on the news.

I've seen and stopped a few parents similar to this in the video, and it's not once or twice.

Making this a self post just 'cause...

This is a little out there for this sub since neither music nor videos of any kind are posted very often, but I thought some of you might find it interesting on one level or another. I'm a musician who's been in Kobe for the past eight years, and have the rather dubious distinction of being one of the few blonde Alaskan foreigners writing Japanese rock songs in deep Kansai dialect.

Some background: I used to be in a band called ヒダリ. We had some minor success and did a couple nation-wide releases on the same label as Quruli that never really took off, but allowed us the opportunity to tour from Sendai to Fukuoka and hit Tokyo about once a month or so.

You can see me here in our ode to wine:
[ヒダリ - 葡萄酒讃](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP9BwemreOM)

Here's a cover of a みんなのうた song we did for a compilation album. You may recognize it if you've been in country for a while:
[ヒダリ - メトロポリタン美術館](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiR0fWQ8IQ)

I quit the band years ago, and have been working solo for the most part. I've been fortunate to play a few large festivals in Kansai, including Comin' Kobe this last Tuesday, whose attendance was estimated at 35000 people. (It was probably less than that due to the pissing down of rain, but still...)

Which brings me to the point of this post...

Shooting was done by holding my iPhone at arm's length and praying my head was in frame and in focus for enough of the take that I'd have some usable footage. Editing was done by trial and error. But I'm rather proud of it, despite that.

This post is partly shameless self-promotion, but I'd mainly like it to be educational since most of you aren't really my target demographic. (Which is drunk Japanese 30-somethings, I think?) So if you have any comments about the video specifically or general questions about what it's like being in a lower middle-range Japanese indie rock band or whatever, ask away and I'll answer to the best of my knowledge.

Also, please review how you're supposed to use downvotes.  Thanks!

EDIT: A few posters seem to be confusing the point of the post i.e. That it's some rally for support for me to just plug in my charger wherever I damn well please at Liberty.  It's not.  Company policy is to ask permission, which I did.  I wouldn't assume otherwise.

The point of the post is about the belief that charging a phone at work is forbidden specifically at your own company, on account of it being theft.   Charging a phone at work = stealing electricity?"

japan,"My girlfriend has this perspective and bias that Japan is the best place to live and best of everything. It gets really annoying. I wanted to present some claims she has made and I want those who lives in Japan or had lived in Japan to evaluate these claims to provide me some insight.

&amp;nbsp;

Before I get into that, I want to provide some background about my girlfriend. My girlfriend is 25% Japanese and was born in the US. She has relatives in Japan in Hiroshima. As a child she has lived back-and-forth between the US and Japan. When she became established, she lived in Japan for 10 years and has a degree in Japanese study. She can speak Japanese fluently even with the Japanese accent and everything just to clarify that she is not a weebo. She definitely knows her Japanese history and has a love for history in general. Due to personal reasons, she unfortunately had to return to the US and experience cultural shock when she found American unmannerly and rude. She was not used to live back here in the US. This is when she became jaded and developed this hatred towards the US and Americans, and always likes to point out how Japan is superior than the US in every way possible as if Japan is heaven and there is no single flaw.

&amp;nbsp;

As for me, I am also born in the US too and I am half Chinese and half Vietnamese. I am not racist against Japanese but I just find it so annoying when I hear her one-sided perspective and bias.

&amp;nbsp;

According to my girlfriend:

&amp;nbsp;

1) ""Japan is so much nicer. In Japan, people are generally more mindful and well-mannered. Compare to here in America where we live in Chicago, we have these stupid hoodlums, thugs, rude fat white people, teenage girls that get pregnant at a young age. In Japan, it's way much different.""

&amp;nbsp;

2) ""The police here in Chicago and in America in general are a joke. Some of them look out of shape. How are they supposed to run to catch a criminal. The physical that cops need to take probably have low standards in order for them to pass.

&amp;nbsp;

In Japan, they do not use firearms because they are actually trained to learn martial arts. Also, there is like a police booth around each corner of each street in Japan. They also make a huge announcement that the curfew hour is about to begin and everyone who is not of age should return to their homes immediately.""

&amp;nbsp;

3) ""The doctors are better in Japan. The doctors here in America are a joke and do not even know what they are doing. These days you see these nurses or RNs (registered nurse) with tramp stamps and tattoos. You get multiple doctors looking at one patient's record and do not even know what they are doing.

&amp;nbsp;

Also in Japan, there is free medical insurance.""

&amp;nbsp;

4) ""The food in Japan is so much better with higher quality and there food ingredients are fresh.""

&amp;nbsp;

5) ""In Japan, everyone keeps to themselves. No one is rude and butts into your business because in Japanese culture, everyone respects each other's privacy (part of being polite)""

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 1:**


6) ""The services at stores in Japan are way better than service here in the US because in Japan, the employees work hard because the Japanese believe that the work they perform reflects what kind of person they are and their reputation so they do their best to deliver the best service to customers unlike the US.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 2:**

7) ""In the US here, they do not help the homeless. In Japan, there is a shelter or a place for the homeless to go to and they pair the homeless people in Japan with jobs base on their skillset or what they are capable of to provide a way for them to get back on the feet. In the US, you are left out to die if you are homeless.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 3:**
I did not expect this to blow up and receive this many responses. I am sorry that I cannot respond to each one of you, but I do appreciate everyone's input and I do enjoy reading everyone's comments. I am sorry if I offended anyone. I do not have hatred towards Japan, but I did wanted someone to clarify these arguments my girlfriend had about Japan. If course I couldn't confront her due to get bias.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you everyone. I am still going to continue to read everyone's input :) 

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 4:**
I need to clarify a huge misunderstanding here. I am aware that my initial post came off like ""Japan is not any better than America"" or ""America is better than Japan"" or that I am some crazy angry person who hates Japan.

&amp;nbsp;

**Disclaimer:**

* I do not hate Japan. America is not better than Japan, nor is Japan is better than America. Every country has its ups and downs. For me to claim that one country is better than another country without experience living in both countries will be a poor judgment and very immature on my part.

* Do not confuse my girlfriend's hatred to America as my own perspective towards American lifestyle VS Japanese lifestyle. That is my girlfriend's attitude towards America. Do not perceive it as my own.

* I would like to live in Japan and experience it myself to experience to understand the culture myself. There are many things in Japan that I find interesting and I believe it will be a very insightful experience regardless if I have to go through the good and bad.

* When you have a girlfriend who is not Japanese but lived in Japan for 10 years who is bitter about being forced to move back to US away from Japan which was more fitting towards her preference, and argues everyday or every other day how America is a shithole compared to Japan, it gets pretty aggravating. I do not hate America. I do not hate Japan. I am upset at my girlfriend's unfair judgment because every country is not perfect and to say one country is better than another without providing a fair analyze and pros and cons for both sides, all you will see is a bitter and ignorant person with a poor sense of judgment. What is worse, that person is my significant other. Thus leading to the creation of this post because I just needed to get this off my chest and verify if what my girlfriend say is actually true.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 5:**

With all the responses and input, I think I have a better understanding why my girlfriend behaves the way she does now. Typical American behavior here annoys her because she is very used to Japanese people being ""polite"" or putting on a persona of being polite.

&amp;nbsp;

She hates human interaction here in America and prefers the self-service machines/robots in Japan because it's more satisfying for an end-user or consumer like her. She has that ""Get out of my way"" mentality ""I am here to get into the store. Buy my stuff. Get out. Don't need to deal with no human error from a cashier or clerk. Such convenience and more comfortable to do things on my own pace operating a self-service machine/robot than working with a human cashier or clerk.""

&amp;nbsp;

She rather have phony smiles and accommodation from customer service from stores and shops than honesty. At least she gets good services and her customer needs are met. That is more important to her and they get the job done regardless if the employees have to be fake.

&amp;nbsp;

Even though most of you say that the Japanese police do not do anything. I think my girlfriend likes the delusion and comfort from the thought simply knowing there is a police booth nearby, regardless how effective the Japanese police are, compare to not having any police around compare to here in Chicago. Having police nearby gives her a peace of mind regardless of their effectiveness.",Validate my girlfriend's claims about Japan,"My girlfriend has this perspective and bias that Japan is the best place to live and best of everything.

I'm new to reddit and I'm looking for some advice because I don't know where else to turn to. 

Basically I have a girlfriend in Japan, while I live in North America. In Japanese culture, it's common for Japanese women to become stay at home wives. I'm not sure I'm completely comfortable with this. I'm not sure I would be able to find a well paying job in Japan because my level of Japanese isn't that high. Even if I bring her back to North America, I feel like it wouldn't make much of a difference. I feel that having a one income in North America is even more pressure. 

Does anyone here have experience with something similar to this or know anyone who does? I'd really appreciate any advice from reddit.

japan,"Long-time Okinawa expat here. Been lurking reddit for years, getting tired of seeing misinformation every time Okinawa comes up, so here's a little rundown for those who are interested. 

Source: Living in Okinawa since 2004. American but no connection to the military. I teach at one of the local universities here. Living out here because my wife is local Okinawan and her family is here. She's a doctor here, I met her at a conference in Hawaii many years ago. Not big on debating politics, but it's annoying to see clear misinformation being spread around, hence this post. 
  
Rationale for posting: 99% of Americans that speak up on reddit about Okinawan issues are military related. Here's the thing - military related folk don't have an entirely unbiased view. Thought experiment: a group of mostly 18-25 year-old people, mostly from rural areas, mostly without any college education, gets sent to a foreign country where they live almost completely isolated from the local community. For a lot of them, this is their first time outside the US. They don't speak the language, they don't know the culture, and they can't communicate with people. They spend most of their time on the bases, which are like little self-contained American cities, complete with fast food joints, bowling alleys, golf courses, and swimming pools. They drive, but they don't need to take a Japanese road test. They fly in and out, but don't need to go through Japanese immigration. When they do go out into town, they go to bars and clubs that exist primarily to cater to them. Their interaction with locals is mostly through this lens, or with the few thousand locals who work on the bases and are thus dependent on the bases for their livelihood. After a few years of this kind of superficial interaction, they leave and are immediately replaced with a new wave of fresh faced young people. Of course, I'm generalizing, but this is the reality for most Americans down here. Would you really expect this kind of population to be your expert source on local affairs? It's like if a Chinese immigrant moved to NYC Chinatown, worked in a restaurant there, never learned English, and left after a few years. Would he really be an expert source on American history and politics?

So let's get on to the most obvious misconceptions. If I went through every single issue (economics, pollution and environmental issues, local history, crime rates and incidents, life under occupation, 1972 reversion, protest movements, Henoko construction) this would be a book. And there are already dozens of books on these issues. So I'll just cover a few of the more obvious problems. If you really want to know more about these things, I suggest you look into some of them.

1) ""Most anti-base protesters are paid"", ""most protesters are not even Okinawan and are from China/North Korea"", ""only a small vocal minority of Okinawans are anti-base"", ""anti-base protests are counterproductive and just a knee-jerk reaction""

Oh man. This is what happens when you mix total ignorance about history and politics with Alex Jones level conspiracy theories. Some quick history. Okinawa was occupied by the US from 1945-1972. The US wanted a forward position from which they could project power during the cold war (in simpler terms, a forward position from which to bomb Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). Some fortifications were left behind by the Japanese, but the US wanted a much larger military build-up, so they needed more land. This land was forcibly seized from locals. Those who resisted were arrested. 

Of course, Japan now pays rent for this land, but because the economy was mostly agrarian, thousands of people at the time were left homeless. These farmers started the first wave of anti-base protests during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1970s, sentiment was shifting against the Vietnam War both at home in America, and also in mainland Japan and in Okinawa. Planes were flying out daily from Okinawa to go on bombing runs in Vietnam, and the American military population swelled to 100,000. Locals here didn't want to be part of a war they had nothing to do with, and for Japan's newly pacifist society, the whole situation was seen as a political embarrassment. During the occupation years, locals had their own community police, and Americans had their own military police. If Americans committed crimes against locals, the locals had to report it to the American military police, who often didn't even speak Japanese. Even if crimes were reported, nothing was usually done, and there was no mechanism for redress. Obviously, given these circumstances, most crimes committed by Americans against locals went unreported, because why bother? For particularly embarrassing crimes such as serial robbery or murder, offending service members were just shipped off the island. All this came to a head with the Koza riots in 1972. American politicians, realizing the situation was out of control, came to an agreement with Japan to transfer Okinawa back to Japan, with the caveat that all the bases would remain indefinitely in Okinawa. Of course, Okinawans weren't consulted in the matter. The third wave of protests kicked off with the 1995 rape incident. A lot of people don't seem to understand this incident. The anger wasn't that the rape had occurred, per se, but the circumstances surrounding the rape. Because the 4 Americans had been talking beforehand, and allegedly other service members had heard them, it was hard to accept the ""one bad apple"" or ""crazy lone wolf"" argument. At least 4 service members, possibly more, knew of the plan and did nothing to stop it. The victim was a 12 year old schoolgirl walking home from the bookstore. The perpetrators had prepared a rental car and duct tape, and had spent several hours driving around looking for a suitable victim. Although the crime was immediately reported and local police knew who the perpetrators were, because they were safely on base, they weren't handed over to local police until a month had passed. Even after they were handed over, the perpetrators' families didn't apologize and instead blamed the locals, saying that it was their fault the rape happened because Japanese people are prejudiced against black people. While in prison, the perpetrators continued to write that going through the Japanese judicial system was a violation of their human rights. After their release, one of the perpetrators went back to the US, raped a college girl, killed her, and then committed suicide. 
Of course, rape happens. Many rape victims are raped by locals. The reason people were getting more and more pissed with each day that passed was because they didn't even know whether or not the perpetrators would even be brought out of base to face charges, justifiably because there had been so many cases in the past during occupation where perpetrators were never charged or were just quietly shipped off the island. 

Let's talk politics. The ""Okinawa problem"" or the ""base issue"" has been a major issue in Japanese politics for a long, long time. Yukio Hatoyama, Japan's Prime Minister from 2009-2010, resigned explicitly over the base issue. Local anti-base politicians consistently win a majority of positions in Okinawa. The previous governor lost his position because he switched from a anti-base position to a pro-base position. The current governor won a historic landslide victory on an anti-base position. Polls consistently show 75%-90% of locals support base reduction. It's clearly not a ""vocal minority.""

Let's talk about the ""paid Chinese protesters"" thing. The earliest source for this myth started when AFN (Armed Forces Network) started partnering with Channel Sakura, a Japanese ultra-nationalist station from the mainland, to spread this story. For those who don't know, far-right Japanese groups hate Koreans, Chinese, Okinawans, mixed races... basically, anyone who isn't pure-blood Japanese. They believe stuff like the emperor is literally divine, WW2 was a righteous struggle, or things like Nanking or other Japanese war crimes never happened. Think of them as Japan's version of neo-nazis. They organized a couple dozen people to cover their cars in North Korean and Chinese flags and drive around anti-base protests, and then worked with AFN to spread the story that most of the protesters are paid North Koreans or Chinese.

2) ""Okinawa is poor, and the American military is keeping the economy afloat"" (or the more blunt ""Okinawans against bases are ungrateful freeloaders"")

Yes, Okinawa is the poorest of Japan's prefectures. However, expenses are much lower, so their standard of living is actually quite high. Why are expenses much lower? Okinawans have large extended families, mostly living in close proximity. A lot of people live in 3 generation homes (grandparents, parents, and kids). People often take care of each others' kids, and a lot of people use hand-me-down clothing or other items from relatives.
  
Most people belong to at least one social financing group, called ""moai"" groups. These groups started hundreds of years ago as community financing associations, but what it boils down to is a group of friends/coworkers/classmates getting together once a month or so for a party. Each member brings a fixed amount of money, usually between $100-$1000, and gives it to one person, and they rotate every time. Essentially, people are always giving and making interest free loans to each other, which keeps people out of financial emergencies and keeps social bonds tight.

Let's think about it another way. Let's pretend that Okinawans really are living in poverty. Poverty usually leads to bad things. Things like high crime, breakdown of social structures, and low life expectancy. However, Okinawa has one of the longest life expectancies in the world. It also has one of the lowest violent crime rates in the world. 

Let's get into economics. Military service members do some shopping in town. Of course, they do most of their shopping on base (the prices on base tend to be better for most things). They do frequent some bars, clubs, and restaurants. The bases employ a couple thousand locals. Including family members and contractors, we're talking some 50,000 people, or about 3-4% of the local population (around 1.4 million people). Japan also pays rent to the landowners whose land the bases are sitting on. According to Japan's government stats, the bases and related jobs make up around 4-5% of the local economy. So is this a positive? Absolutely, overwhelmingly, no. The bases are huge sprawling mini-cities that cover around 20% of the land, and around 33% of the prime, centrally located, non-mountainous land. Take a look at a map of the island. Because the bases are sprawling and cover the center of the island, people have to drive around them to get anywhere. A 10 minute straight drive suddenly becomes a 40 minute winding drive. Everything slows down. Think about what that does for efficiency. When base land is returned, the surrounding area usually makes between 10 times or 20 times as much money. These couple thousand base jobs come at a steep, steep cost for the other 1.4 million people.

Tourism revenue is increasing dramatically. Around 10 million tourists come every year, and it increases every year. Direct flights have opened up to Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Korea, and several other nearby countries. Okinawa is only 1 hour from Taipei, and 2 hours from Shanghai. Resort hotels run for a few hundred dollars a night. A nice dinner is between 50-100 dollars. Go to any of these places, and you won't see a single American face. It's all middle or upper class locals, domestic tourists from the mainland, and foreign tourists from Taiwan, China, or Korea. Meanwhile, the old American entertainment districts, Gate 2 street and BC street, which used to be booming in the 1970s, are now shuttering and closing their doors. Most of the girls who work these bars and clubs are now from Thailand or the Philippines, because locals have more opportunities and don't have to do that kind of work anymore.

Other major economic considerations: pollution. The bases are used to store munitions and chemical weapons. There are and have been leaks. When land is returned, the local government, not the US, has the responsibility to pay for clean-up. Noise. The bases are amazingly noisy. Tourists paying hundreds of dollars for a room generally don't like it when jets buzz their room at 2 in the morning, so tourist development is limited to very narrow areas. 
*****	 

I could keep going, but you get the picture. The situation here can't really be reduced to ""Okinawans stupid! Americans good!"" Personally, having lived here for a long time, I think there will always be some military presence here, or for as long as the US retains global dominance, which will probably be for a long time. The US needs/wants their global network of bases for power projection. 70 years ago, the ""threat"" was the USSR, then hot spots like Korea and Vietnam, and now the ""threat"" is China. There will always be some sort of ""threat"" in Asia. Japan wants US backing, considering only 20 years ago Japan's economy was by far the largest in Asia, a position that has been taken over by China. And the US wants Japan to act as a proxy in regional affairs. I don't see these things changing in the near future. But I think it's a tall order for locals to say ""yes, we're just a pawn in a game between great powers, let's just go home and take it then."" Maybe protesting is useless. Maybe voting is useless. Maybe no matter what people do, they'll be at the mercy of bigger, stronger forces. But I don't see why they shouldn't try. 
 
Locals aren't dumb, or protesting against themselves, or overly emotional. They have legitimate concerns. People are working, and have been working, on both sides, behind the scenes over the nitty gritty stuff. It's like Occupy Wall Street. People have legitimate concerns, like crazy student debt, influence of money in politics, etc. but it's easy for the media to interview some hippy looking dude who just says ""I want free stuff man!"" Same thing here. It's easy to sell a story interviewing someone who says ""Marines are rapists! Marines go home!"" Politics don't occur in a vacuum. Events happen, politicians respond. Orlando happens, the talking heads send out their tweets. Public opinion is only captured by shocking events. The reality is much more nuanced. ",Okinawan expat here. Here's the inside info on what's going on down here.,"Long-time Okinawa expat here. Been lurking reddit for years, getting tired of seeing misinformation every time Okinawa comes up, so here's a little rundown for those who are interested. 

Source: Living in Okinawa since 2004. American but no connection to the military. I teach at one of the local universities here. Living out here because my wife is local Okinawan and her family is here. She's a doctor here, I met her at a conference in Hawaii many years ago. Not big on debating politics, but it's annoying to see clear misinformation being spread around, hence this post. 
  
Rationale for posting: 99% of Americans that speak up on reddit about Okinawan issues are military related. Here's the thing - military related folk don't have an entirely unbiased view. Thought experiment: a group of mostly 18-25 year-old people, mostly from rural areas, mostly without any college education, gets sent to a foreign country where they live almost completely isolated from the local community. For a lot of them, this is their first time outside the US. They don't speak the language, they don't know the culture, and they can't communicate with people. They spend most of their time on the bases, which are like little self-contained American cities, complete with fast food joints, bowling alleys, golf courses, and swimming pools. They drive, but they don't need to take a Japanese road test. They fly in and out, but don't need to go through Japanese immigration. When they do go out into town, they go to bars and clubs that exist primarily to cater to them. Their interaction with locals is mostly through this lens, or with the few thousand locals who work on the bases and are thus dependent on the bases for their livelihood. After a few years of this kind of superficial interaction, they leave and are immediately replaced with a new wave of fresh faced young people. Of course, I'm generalizing, but this is the reality for most Americans down here. Would you really expect this kind of population to be your expert source on local affairs? It's like if a Chinese immigrant moved to NYC Chinatown, worked in a restaurant there, never learned English, and left after a few years. Would he really be an expert source on American history and politics?

So let's get on to the most obvious misconceptions. If I went through every single issue (economics, pollution and environmental issues, local history, crime rates and incidents, life under occupation, 1972 reversion, protest movements, Henoko construction) this would be a book. And there are already dozens of books on these issues. So I'll just cover a few of the more obvious problems. If you really want to know more about these things, I suggest you look into some of them.

japan,"The interior should be done by sometime next month. It's starting to look like a finished house. Some of the people on Japanlife/JCJ think I'm working by myself. That's not true, I've had 3 carpenters on and off, 1 plumber, 1 electrician, and 1 tiler, then a few random people like gas workers and stuff.  


The house was bought for about $90,000 USD before some of the fees and stuff.

Some of the things we've done:  
All new floors  
All new plumbing  
All new modern electrical wiring  
Walls were recoated and painted  
All new ceilings  
Combined 3 rooms into one living room  
Vaulted the living room and kitchen ceilings  
Demolished the giant wall outside that wrapped around 50% of the house and was about 20ft tall at it's highest.

Here's a link. Now that the scaffolding is out and I can take decent photos I'll update more often if people are interested. Let's see what the chodes on JCJ think &lt;3
