singapore,"Hi everyone.

I’m a victim of a toxic family. The toxicity comes in the form of verbal and emotional abuse. The Police have come to our house multiple times. But since no physical abuse or violence is involved, they can’t do anything or place arrests. 

Managed to survive CB and COVID by staying long hours at the office and using co-working spaces, only going home to sleep. When I start Uni, I’ll be applying to stay in Hall, work while studying to earn money, then move out upon graduation.

The effects of a toxic family member doesn’t end the moment you move out. You are still affected. Your self-esteem is low, you struggle with making friends or building relationships. 

You can seek therapy, but anyone who has gone through therapy will tell you that the bulk of it requires you to put in the work yourself. Your therapist is not a magic fix-all that cures you from your past on your first session.

Fixing yourself is a long process. As a victim, it isn’t easy to rebuild yourself. At times, it’s difficult to know where to turn to or what resources you can use.

I know I’m not alone in this. So I’ve decided to put together a list of resources for victims of toxic families to know what options they have to do something about their situation. 

I intend to compile this as a list of URLs to professional help, resources and service providers, depending on which life stage the victims are at.

I am not a therapist, nor do I want to be one. I am not a mental health professional either. I just want to collect links showing other victims like myself that there are options we could take to get out of our situation. 

See the [resource list here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13QS4GWu58a7jeF6fuW0COkxGYxJMgnK_EhJN-fM9uIs/edit?usp=sharing). 

This is still on a Google Doc because I’d just started very recently. But I’d love to hear the subreddit’s input on what else I can add, or if there are any sections the victims of toxic family members could find helpful. 

If you’d like to be updated about my progress or be a part of this journey, feel free to DM me. Feel free to ask any questions you might have. 

Thanks.",Toxic Family Victims Resource List,"Hi everyone.

To point out a few things before the thread:

1. I'm not trying to shame any individual person but more of the sending a message across to the company responsible
2. I have included all of the chat logs because I did make childish comments to the customer support (aka answering machine since the answers are templated) and it will not be fair if I decided to omit them
3. The part where I ""threatened"" on the social media wasn't going to happen because I just want to achieve my objective - which is the freaking 4 dollars. I decided to share it because it could have been escalated to the correct team before the ""threatening""
4. And the last part where I was counting down, it was just a eyes-rolling moment where I have already given up (it was a long day after work and I just want my freaking rest), of course no follow-up came through even after a few hours, just another case of ""I promised you the moon but delivered nothing""

Here comes the story:

I'm sure all of us has bought something online before and the order came as unfulfilled or wrongly delivered (my friend per-ordered Final Fantasy 7 Remake and a hair curler was delivered, can you imagine the rude shock especially when it was managed by a well-known game shop?).

Usually when this happens, we can easily request for a refund or an exchange. However, this is not the case for me.

I made my first purchase on PandaMart yesterday and ended up wasting my time for 4 dollars because of an unfulfilled order (I have also lost some blood because of the internal injury I talking to the customer service).

The delivery was smooth but I was informed by the delivery staff that someone has told him that I have already been notified of the shortage of a product, but this did not happen.

So instead of  2 x ""Mushroom Gourmet Sliced White Button - 200"", I only received 1 packet.

I was still wondering if I have missed a call or email but brushed it off thinking that the refund will be made soon, or at least within 24 hours.

Within the delivered items, a note from FoodPanda was provided with the following instructions:

*""Your item(s) may have been unavailable and you will not be charged for them""*

*""Check your email for an updated invoice within 24 hours""*

*""Kindly reach out to our customer service team under the help centre to request  for a refund should you not get it after 24 hours.""*

To this point, I have already gave up on the four dollars and just want to laugh at myself.

The inconsistency in the company's policy is appalling.

So regardless what happened, if you are still using FoodPanda and ""suay suay"" had a unfulfilled order, please reach out to them within 24 hours. Else, you might just have to suffer the same fate as above.

For the companies that mold their customer service support staffs into answering machines, please don't.

There is a reason why you employed them to front the ""customer service"" instead of using chat bots. By the way they responded to their customers, what different does it make?

I am sort of in the customer service line as well and would have been shot a couple of times in the head if I were to respond like that by my clients.

Once again I apologise for the childish comments made during the interaction with the support staff because I wasn't in the right state of mind when it comes to dealing with the ""answering machine"" after a long day.

I have included a link below for companies providing the same service and their charges put up by moneysmart:

**\*\*\*EDIT:\*\*\***

Since this post seems to be gaining some attention, I would like to use this chance to spread awareness about mental health.

Going to prison for drugs and violence sounds bad, but I was not always “like that”. Before covid, everyone knew me as a very nice, gentle person. I had everything going for me. Good grades, started a small business that grew fast and generated just enough money for my monthly expenses in school, had good friends, CCAs, etc.

A few months into Circuit Breaker, I had a mental breakdown. I wasn't living with my family and couldn't meet my friends. Had no one to talk to. It was the first time I had to deal with mental health issues and I had no idea what to do. Going to therapy did not even cross my mind I felt like mental illness was very stigmatized in SG.

&amp;#x200B;

I self-medicated with alcohol and eventually discovered drugs, which led me to commit a violent act while I was under the influence. That’s how I ended up in jail. What’s done is done and now I have to face consequences for my actions.

So please, if you are struggling with mental health, please seek therapy. It’s actually fun and your therapist will not judge you at all. I wonder how many are silently suffering like me…

**\*\*\***

**Edit 2:**

I'm truly speechless at the amount of kind comments and messages I've received over the past few hours. Please keep them coming as they not only help me right now, but could also help any convicts in the future if they chance upon this thread.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you Reddit SG for showing me that there is still kindness and hope in this world.  I just want everyone to know that I've read every single comment/message and will continue to do so until I enter prison.  Might even come back to this thread after my release if I still remember to...

**\*\*\***

**Edit 3:**

RE the lockdowns and mental illnesses, I'm not blaming anyone. I take full responsibility for my actions. **Maybe I'm a bit emotional right now and I made it sound like I'm trying to push the blame of my actions to someone else, I apologise for that.**

&amp;#x200B;

I was just making a point about how badly lockdowns have affected mental health and yet not much has been done about it. There are many suffering like me. I'm just the rare one that lack self control and broke the law.

&amp;#x200B;

Comments about how I'm simply using mental health/illness as an excuse for my actions just proves my point that our society in general is just very ignorant about these issues. Many people think it doesn't exist, or it's exaggerated, or everyone with mental illness are just ""chao keng"" or ""strawberry"".

&amp;#x200B;

I received dozens of messages / comments about how I was stupid for turning to alcohol instead of seeking professional help. I bet none of these guys even experienced any sort of mental illness before. A lot of times when you are mentally unwell, you yourself don't realise it. **If it's so easy to be self-aware about your illnesses and everyone was BORN knowing how to seek professional help, then why are there still so many suicides in the world?**

24M here. Going to prison in 2 weeks for something I committed over a year ago. Don't want to give too many details, but it was related to violence and drugs and I was sentenced about 2 years. I was a senior in Local University but got suspended after my arrest and now will have to drop out.

Never thought about the seriousness of the consequences until today and the future just seems so uncertain now. I have been researching about life in prison and it doesn't seem bad at all. What worries me is the uncertainty after release...

What can I even do after release? Can I ever get a job related to my diploma/degree (Engineering + Business)? Even if I can, will it affect career growth and salary?

Should I even try to get a degree after my release? I am going to be 30-32 years old when I graduate...

Will there be a lot of restrictions on my life (can't work in certain industries, can't go to certain places etc.)?

I made most of my friends from school. How do I rebuild my social life without it? Many of my friends also left me when I got suspended and I'm not sure if I will be left with any at all after 2 years of no contact :(

So many questions... Would really appreciate any sort of advice.",Going to prison soon. Looking for advice.,"# This is a work of fiction.

singapore,"So I made this comment elsewhere, but I thought it might be worth writing a separate post about it given that many people on this sub seem to have the impression that Sarah Bagharib recklessly threw around allegations of racism. I'm not entirely sure I should be drawing more attention to this than it's already getting and will delete this post if requested by anyone involved, but here goes.

As most people on this sub probably know by now, the PA has claimed that Sarah ""*raise[d] the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments*"". I thought it would be worth looking at the exact allegations referenced by the PA to see precisely what they're taking umbrage at.

The PA states that:

&gt;Ms Sarah has **shared claims that this incident “perpetuate the racist culture”**. She **characterised this incident as “racist”**. In her interview with Walid J. Abdullah, she also **insinuated that our staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be “blind to racism""**.

They seem to point to 3 different quotes here, so let's examine them one by one. Since the PA doesn't state exactly which quotes they're referring to, everything below is based on my own educated guesses and might be wrong - take it with a pinch of salt.

Preliminarily, it's worth noting that Sarah's main public statements on this incident have come in the form of 3 Instagram posts (which I'm too lazy to screenshot and upload, can find them on her profile). None of these 3 posts use the word ""racism"". This is somewhat conspicuous to me given the PA's statement, so I think it's worth keeping this in mind when interpreting her Instagram stories. The PA's references therefore appear to be from (1) her old stories, which can also be found on her profile, and (2) her interview with Walid J. Abdullah. 

&gt;1) Shared claims that this incident “perpetuate the racist culture

PA's claim here isn't that she directly made an allegation herself, but that she ""*shared claims*"" that the incident ""*perpetuate[s] the racist culture*"" i.e. that she **reposted someone else's story**. The story in question appears to be [this](https://imgur.com/a/1UZo0Pd).

The main purpose of this repost seems to have been to thank the original poster for being supportive - Sarah does not explicitly state that she agrees with the original poster's statements.

It's not even entirely clear to me that the original poster is referring to this particular incident when they talk about ""*perpetuat[ing] the racist culture*"", they could just as easily have been referring to ""*ignorance*"" generally.

&gt;2) Characterised this incident as “racist”

PA provides no further citation for this, but the [CNA Article](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pa-cancels-meeting-couple-standee-wedding-photo-hari-raya-15011776) states that ""*[t]he PA also said that Ms Sarah characterised the standee incident as “racist” by lumping it with ""other racist attacks and incidents"" in one of her posts*"". It's not clear to me where CNA gets this from since this doesn't appear to be in the PA's original post, but I'll assume it's true.

If that's the case, they appear to be referencing [this story](https://imgur.com/a/UkBfrNL), where Sarah says she's grateful to allies who stood alongside minorities ""*in the aftermath of this incident (and other racist attacks and incidents which have been filmed)*"". This is, at best, an indirect (and possibly unintentional) allusion to the incident being ""*racist*"", and imo certainly doesn't on its own warrant the response she got from the PA.

Think about it - if you wanted to thank people for their support over both this incident and the other incidents we've seen over the past few weeks (with the latter clearly being racist), how would you phrase it? Even if you didn't think this particular incident was racist, could you have ended up with Sarah's phrasing, because your focus was more on thanking people than it was on being very clear about which incidents were racist and which were ""*culturally insensitive*""? While a plain reading appears to lump this in with other racist incidents, it could just as easily have been imprecise phrasing, especially given that Sarah's main posts contained no mention of racism. If the PA had had an issue with this, they could just as easily have interpreted this charitably, contacted her personally, and asked her politely to clarify.

&gt;3) Insinuated that our staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be “blind to racism""

On its face, this is very obviously not an accusation of racism, and doesn't strike me as a particularly serious allegation.

In any case, the quote in question is from her hour-long interview with Walid J. Abdullah (not linking it here because I'm not sure it's allowed under the sub's rules), and appears to be the bit from around 9 minutes - 8.30 minutes before the end of the interview:

""*There was a comment there as well about internalised racism, which, it is what it is, it's so conditioned, to, you know, think that this is a certain way, you know, there's nothing wrong with this because people are colour blind, I guess, or like, blind to racism at play*""

She's not directly referencing the PA, its staff, or this particular incident here, although this follows a segment where she spoke about the possibility of meeting Melvin Yong. In any case, it's quite clear to me that she's not accusing anyone of racism, but of **failing to notice racism**.

In particular, it's worth noting that the context here is ""*internalised racism*"", presumably among minorities who get used to inappropriate behaviour and come to accept it as normal - in other words, it's quite possible that she's talking about **minorities who are blind to racism against themselves**. Her words aren't entirely clear here (likely because she's responding to an IG Live comment on the spot), but even taking the least charitable interpretation possible, she's not accusing the PA of racism.


Personally, assuming everything above is accurate, it's hard for me to resist the conclusion that the PA went out of their way to look for every possible manner in which Sarah could have conceivably accused them of ""*racism*"", and premised their statement on that. It certainly doesn't seem to me that she recklessly threw allegations of racism around, like I've seen many people on this subreddit suggest. 

But hey, this is just my opinion - everyone's free to draw their own conclusions.

Edit: Grammar, added a few points (thanks /u/elmachosierra)

Edit 2: Just as a further addendum - I can't help but notice that posts like this, even when they're defending Sarah, shift the discussion to whether Sarah behaved appropriately, and divert it away from the steps the PA should take to redress its initial wrongdoing and prevent similar future occurrences. It's especially striking given that Sarah is a private citizen, but the PA is a taxpayer-funded body which owes us a significantly greater degree of accountability. This discussion imo really shouldn't revolve around Sarah. Unfortunately, I think it's also important to verify the truth of what the PA says and assess whether they're being fair to a private citizen, so here we are.

In light of this, I think it's worth adding in a reminder of what originally happened and putting this post in context: the PA and/or its vendor downloaded Sarah's wedding photo without her permission, turned into a public standee, completely overlooked its cultural context, issued an apology, but is now disengaging with Sarah and issuing a public rebuttal due to disagreements with her purported characterisation of the issue. This post discusses only *part* of the last bit i.e. whether the PA has characterised Sarah's characterisation correctly (and not whether Sarah's purported characterisation of the incident as racist was fair).","Examining the PA's claim that an ""allegation of racism"" was raised","So I made this comment elsewhere, but I thought it might be worth writing a separate post about it given that many people on this sub seem to have the impression that Sarah Bagharib recklessly threw around allegations of racism.

singapore,"I was on the MRT the other day and got approached by a Chinese lady asking how many stops more to Choa Chu Kang. I had to tell the lady she was taking the train in the wrong direction and she had to alight and take the train the other way. To me, this is a fairly common issue where foreigners coming in are unable to read or speak basic English and may end up causing problems for others and themselves due to poor communication. I also have had experience with colleagues who cannot work with others due to a language barrier (PRCs can only work with Singaporean Chinese, Indians can only work with Singaporean Indians etc.) and witnessed people having trouble ordering food at restaurants/coffeeshops because of this as well. 

So this is where my question comes in, what does everyone think about having a required proficiency test for basic English before foreigners can have their citizenship/ PR approved? Correct me if I am wrong, but I could not find any information on language requirements on the ICA website.

Now, this is on an attempt to be racist or woke or anything like that. From a practical point of view, English is our most commonly used language. It is the main language used in many things such as MRT maps, street signs, government websites (though you can change the language for some) and education. Thus, to me it is practical for everyone coming in to be able to at least speak, read and write basic English. Note that I am not expecting them to churn out English essays on a weekly basis, just to have the proficiency for daily use. We could even make use of existing international standards such as the IELTS.

I have done a little bit of research into how other countries tackle this issue:

* In Japan, JLPT is used as a requirement when applying for graduate programs as a foreigner. JLPT exams also contributes to a point system when trying to obtain permanent residency

* In Korea,  apparently there is a proficiency test for language for reading, writing and speaking. the TOPIK is also used for Korean university applications, work visas, permanent residency and marriage visas etc. 

* Australia also includes a point based system which considered language proficiency. They require a minimum score of 6 in the IELTS for each component.

Having said all these, I understand that there are some points against having a language requirement as well. For instance, our national language is not even English, so that's a big negative point. Another issue is that many elderly Singaporeans are unable to speak English as well, though this issue may be less prominent in coming years. 

While we are at it, should this also be a requirement for work pass holders, visa applications, EPs etc?
Do feel free to have a civil discussion here as I would like to here everyone's thoughts and experiences on this mater

**TLDR: Should SG have minimum English requirements for immigrants?**

Points for:

*  Practicality

* Other nations do it too

* Can use existing international systems


Points against:

* Some Singaporeans cannot speak English either

* Our national language is Malay, not English

And maybe the overly sensitive people here can take some advice from Amrin Amin ❄️❄️❄️❄️",Should new Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents pass language tests?,"I was on the MRT the other day and got approached by a Chinese lady asking how many stops more to Choa Chu Kang. I had to tell the lady she was taking the train in the wrong direction and she had to alight and take the train the other way. To me, this is a fairly common issue where foreigners coming in are unable to read or speak basic English and may end up causing problems for others and themselves due to poor communication. I also have had experience with colleagues who cannot work with others due to a language barrier (PRCs can only work with Singaporean Chinese, Indians can only work with Singaporean Indians etc.) and witnessed people having trouble ordering food at restaurants/coffeeshops because of this as well. 

So this is where my question comes in, what does everyone think about having a required proficiency test for basic English before foreigners can have their citizenship/ PR approved? Correct me if I am wrong, but I could not find any information on language requirements on the ICA website.

Now, this is on an attempt to be racist or woke or anything like that. From a practical point of view, English is our most commonly used language. It is the main language used in many things such as MRT maps, street signs, government websites (though you can change the language for some) and education. Thus, to me it is practical for everyone coming in to be able to at least speak, read and write basic English.

The implicit assumption, of course, is that racial harmony is defined as merely an absence of loud protests and violence.

singapore,"To be fair, the Singapore government has taken some steps in recent years to improve data protection, in light of cyberattacks and data breaches locally and internationally. PDPA, originally introduced in 2012, saw major amendments last year (2020), and PDPC was created to implement and enforce the act. Monetary grants have also been offered, such as the Cybersecurity Capability Grant, among other means to encourage improved cybersecurity.

Yet despite everything, data protection in Singapore is still quite subpar. And worse still is that the fines imposed can hardly act as a deterrence and warn firms to get their game together.

Just very recently, it was reported that [HMI Institute of Health Sciences was fined only $35,000 for a major data breach that took place in 2019](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/singapore-firms-fined-75000-for-personal-data-lapses-affecting-over-600000-people).

&gt;This included the data of **98,000 Ministry of Defence staff and Singapore Armed Forces servicemen** exposed during a breach in 2019 due to a **well-known vulnerability that was knowingly left open for more than four years** by healthcare training provider HMI Institute of Health Sciences.  
&gt;  
&gt;HMI was fined **$35,000** for the incident, according to a judgment issued by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) last Thursday (June 10).

With the latest amendments to PDPA, companies can be fined up to 10% of their annual turnover or S$1m for a data breach, whichever is higher. According to [this file](https://links.sgx.com/FileOpen/HMI%20-%20Q4FY19%20Results%20Announcement%20-%2019%20Aug%202019.ashx?App=Announcement&amp;FileID=575305), Health Management International (HMI), which owns HMI Institute of Health Sciences, recorded a **profit-after-tax amount of more than S$13m and S$19m in FY2019 and FY2018 respectively**.

The Straits Times article also mentioned how web design company Webcada was fined S$25,000 for a ransomware attack in 2020 that affected the personal data of 522,722 individuals, with the exact number provided by PDPC. I'm unable to access any public records of the firm's financial reports, but **it seems to be a much smaller firm compared to HMI and most likely brings in a much smaller profit after tax**.

I've read through both judgements passed by PDPC, and even then it still seems unconvincing that the financial penalties imposed were so lax. It is difficult to imagine that sufficient warning and signal can be sent by imposing a fine that seems so comparatively insignificant to factors such as the seriousness of the penalty and the individual company's financial situation. I mean, ransomware attacks and other cybersecurity threats haven't exactly become more uncommon anyway.

I'd think that harsher penalties have to be in place to send a stronger warning to companies, and maybe a greater emphasis on education regarding data protection as well, since I've also heard that cybersecurity still isn't being taken very seriously in a number of places. 

At the moment it's hard to see that Singapore and Singaporeans can thrive in the digital age. Especially when Singapore is trying very hard to become and portray itself as a Smart Nation.

But certainly all this is only my humble opinion on the situation, and also **I'm interested to hear what those more familiar on this (perhaps students and working adults in related fields) have to say about all this as well!**",Singapore's overly lax stance against data protection,"To be fair, the Singapore government has taken some steps in recent years to improve data protection, in light of cyberattacks and data breaches locally and internationally.

singapore,"Ik I should do this in r/SGExams but I want to get the opinions of not only students, but parents and educators as well.

We have all heard that there is significant amounts of stress in students resulting from kiasuness, school work, tuition, sometimes parents, etc. And that there have been rising reported cases of mental health problems resulting from this academic stress. However, other than the obvious physical exhaustion in other students, I haven't personally seen much of other effects of this stress (or it's just that I've gotten used to it and never noticed it).

So, can the (past or present) students of Singapore (whether at the primary, secondary, or tertiary level) describe their school experiences or of those around them? I am also trying to learn more about whether being in an elite school affects the stress level in any significant way, so it would help a lot if you could specify that (I won't judge), thank you!

For parents / adults in general, what do you think about the current education system and the stress that the students get? Is it necessary/useful? What would you do to reduce or relieve the stress that the students get (short of completely reforming the education system ofc, that's not coming anytime soon)?

singapore,"For a country that prides itself for its ‘racial harmony,’ our discussions and responses to dialogue on racism are strangely inconsistent. But one of the concerning prevailing features is a lack of empathy displayed in many conversations concerning recent incidences.

Time and time again, we have heard many accounts from people that clearly demonstrate racism has always persisted in Singaporean society. Some incidents attract straightforward outrage, while others are more polarising. There seems to be a misconception that there is a certain ‘threshold’ that actions and words have to meet in order to be considered firmly as racism. As if the line between what is ‘racist’ and not is set in stone. This dangerously ignores more subtle, and arguably more insidious, forms of racism – whether it is discriminatory attitudes in the workplace or school under the guise of procedure, or in throwaway or backhanded comments. 

Racism is also not a homogenous collective experience. It is experienced differently across the board, not just based solely on race or ethnicity. It varies depending on an individual’s socioeconomic background, physical appearance, age, gender identity, and other aspects (i.e. it is intersectional). The policing of what is categorically racist (and what is not) shows: one, an inability to conceptualise nuance; and two, an unwillingness to listen to those that are subjected to it.

When defending occurrences that are not so clear-cut, a common counter-argument that is raised is that no individual can know of all cultural details and knowledge, so actions stemmed from ignorance may be insensitive, but not racist. Ignorance may not be a crime nor ill-intended, but it is a breeding ground for toxic and narrow-minded attitudes that can escalate. We must hold ourselves and each other accountable for our ignorance and work against it. To counter ignorance, one has to proactively listen and be receptive to the unfamiliar, while accepting one’s own  limitations. It is not a specific epiphany or about getting it right that one time, it is a continuous journey of listening and learning.

That is why occurrences as recent as People’s Association's response (re: wedding photo-Hari Raya incident) or Amrin Amin’s ‘snowflake’ comment are so frustrating: it is an institutional refusal to listen. Preoccupied with whether they are in the ‘right’ or ‘wrong,’ they have failed to respect procedures that enable community engagement and feedback. They have accepted their own version of events, and are moving forward with it without any deference for the communities and people they are supposed to serve. (And these circumstances have repeated themselves in many other contexts.) It is a poor example of civic-minded behaviour and allows frustrations to dangerously fester in the long term.

TLDR; or in conclusion: To be circumstantially tolerant is not the same as acceptance. Downplaying and rejecting incidences as not-racist-enough perpetuates a harmful cycle of selective deafness. Don’t wave around “a listening ear and a willing heart” and not actually do it. We should be challenging ourselves to proactively listening and learning, and fostering an environment of trust and receptiveness that can only contribute to our community’s resilience.

DISCLAIMER: I am generally a silent observer on this subreddit, being both introverted and anxious in general. But I too am still learning. I think it is important for us to remember that choosing to listen is an action in itself, and can only bolster our capacity for effective action and support.

Once there was a king, Tiger Ali Wilbur. They called him Tiger Ali Wilbur because he liked to kill. He is proud, and he liked to wear tiger stripes. 

Late one night, when the owls were hooting, three men wearing tattered and torn clothes rushed into the royal palace where the king was, still awake. They said, panting, ""\*\*puff\*\* Oh your highness, \*\*cough\*\* we have come to inform you that Singapore is being invaded by killer sharks. These great whites are coming in sizes of.... they're indescribable! They're as long as three men standing on top of each other. Please help us, great king.""

The proud king never realised what trouble his country was suffering, until...

""No *problemo*, great king,"" replied the chef.

That night, the chef set out for some fish, and never returned. The king shouted, ""Where is that chef of mine? Guards! Find him! Now! I'm hungry!""

The guards set out to find the chef, but all they found were bones. Now, the king was scared.

The next day, a midget came along.

""Hey, king! I know how to get rid of the sharks!""

""How?"" asked the king.

""By throwing pieces of meat into the vast sea.""

The guards did just that, and Singapore was saved!

Everyone was so glad. The whole island rejoiced, except for the king. He was getting jealous of the midget's knowledge and wisdom. So one night, he ordered his men to go to the top of the hill where the midget lived, and kill him. 

The guards set out, but alas! When they reached there, the midget was still awake. They charged in and stabbed the midget to death. His blood flowed down the hill, and it turned red.

Background

On 28 May 2021, PA was alerted by Ms Sarah Bagharib that Radin Mas Constituency Office (CO) had used her wedding photo without permission, and inappropriately for a Hari Raya occasion. We immediately removed the standee, and apologised to Ms Sarah and Mr Razif Abdullah for our mistake. We also posted a public apology on our social media platforms.

--------------------------------------- 

1. The People’s Association (PA) had offered to meet with Ms Sarah Bagharib and her husband, Mr Razif Abdullah, to apologise to them, in person, for the distress caused by our mistakes regarding the use of their wedding photo for the Hari Raya decorations at Tiong Bahru Orchid estate. We also wished to clarify our position, elaborate on the steps we have taken to prevent such incidents from recurring, and hear her suggestions of how we might improve at the meeting.

--------------------------------------- 

2.  In our exchange of emails, we had explained to Ms Sarah that PA values racial and religious harmony in Singapore.  We had also explained that whilst we accept our staff should have been more culturally sensitive, we should not form sweeping conclusions from this incident.

--------------------------------------- 

3.  However, Ms Sarah has shared claims that this incident “perpetuate the racist culture”. She characterised this incident as “racist”. In her interview with Walid J. Abdullah, she also insinuated that our staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be “blind to racism”.

--------------------------------------- 

4.  These are accusations we reject. While the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist. It is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments.

--------------------------------------- 

5.  To add to this, Ms Sarah shared in her recent public posts that she will be meeting with us, and has made a public call for anyone to “please share your messages/suggestions to PA here and we’ll share them”.  We find this odd.  We do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident.

--------------------------------------- 

6.  All these lead us to believe her purpose in agreeing to meet with us has gone far beyond the Radin Mas incident. We therefore see no point in proceeding with the meeting.

--------------------------------------- 

7.  PA remains steadfast in its mission to promote racial harmony in Singapore. That is an essential part of our raison d’etre. Our grassroots organisations such as the Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (MESRA) and the Indian Activity Executive Committees Council (Narpani Pearavai) play a key role in representing the interests of the Malay and Indian communities respectively. We regularly reach out to numerous community partners among all our races and religions to ensure that their concerns are actively considered when designing our programmes.

--------------------------------------- 

8.  Though what happened at Radin Mas was an isolated incident, it nevertheless shows our organisation can fall short.  We agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.  We are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters. We will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of our different cultures. Singaporeans becoming “one people” is a work in progress – and so is the PA.

--------------------------------------- 

9.  There is one further point which we would like to reiterate. Ms Sarah’s email of 1 June alleged that we were “hasty in sharing the name of the vendor” in order to “distance and deflect blame” from ourselves.  This is untrue. The vendor had identified himself directly to Ms Sarah on 28 May, and apologised. This was before PA issued our statement on 29 May.

--------------------------------------- 

10.  It is regrettable that Ms Sarah did not clarify this point during her Instagram Live interview with Mr Walid J. Abdullah on 7 June. Instead she persisted in conveying the impression that PA had deflected blame from itself. 

--------------------------------------- 

11.  PA recognises that enhancing our understanding of Singapore’s various races, religions and cultures is a ceaseless effort – this lapse having been a good reminder of this. The vast majority of PA staff and its many volunteers work hard for our community, and are very mindful and conscious of the need to build and strengthen our social harmony, through recognising and respecting racial diversity. We hope that this incident will not tar the other good work which our staff and volunteers have done.",PA STATEMENT ON THE USE OF PHOTO IN HARI RAYA DECORATIONS,"---------------------------------------

singapore,"I have been seeing posts of a similar nature floating around social media platforms (TikTok, Instagram, even Hardwarezone) over the past few months. A guy has been going around messaging influencer girls on Instagram, offering them 3,000-5,000 SGD an hour in exchange for them partaking in a bukkake photoshoot. He writes in a professional tone, going so far as to describe the photoshoot concept as ""the juxtaposition of sperm with the beauty of the female form."" This constitutes sexual harassment, which includes communications of a sexual nature meant to cause the other party harassment, alarm or distress or is likely to cause them those feelings.

Girls, watch out for this person!

P.S. Identities have been made anonymous.

Edit: It seems that many people think there’s nothing wrong with soliciting for such photoshoots, and I agree - to a certain extent. There’s nothing wrong with doing porn. But if he had truly wanted to solicit for this shoot, he could have posted his job posting on websites so that willing parties can approach him. 

He sent these messages to specifically regular young and impressionable girls between ages 18-20. And worded it as a professional business proposal so that they are likelier to agree. There is a seemingly accepted view that women can be approached casually for such shoots. The messages are objectifying and demeaning to girls - regardless of how transparent the solicitor is with his proposal, is it really normal to approach a regular girl on the street and ask to cum on her face?

And if readers really believe one can get such a ridiculously high sum of money so easily, it’s up to their discretion but remember that if it’s good to be true, it is probably too good to be true.

singapore,"Hi guys, today is June 14th which marks World Blood Donor Day. Here's some simple facts about me. I'm a 20-year-old NSF who is also a regular blood donor who have donated 26 times and I'm hoping to encourage more youths in Singapore to donate blood. I usually donate platelets via apheresis and hence I'm able to donate every month. Over the years, the number of youth blood donors aged between 16 and 25 has been decreasing, perhaps due to our aging population. With an aging population, Singapore would need more blood stocks but currently, only about 1.78 percent of the population in Singapore donate blood last year. 

June 14th marks world blood donor day and I hope that more would come forward to donate blood this week, especially those who are working from home or having a 9-5 job. As the Covid-19 restrictions eases today June 14th, it would be great to bring our your friends or family members to come along and donate blood. 

For those of you who are afraid of pain, well, I can guarantee that the pain lasts only for a few seconds, somewhat similar to the pain when receiving your first Covid-19 vaccine. In fact, donating blood is meant to be a fun and relaxing process  Before donation, try to drink as much water as you can to stay hydrated and eat fruits that are high in Vitamin C such as orange, kiwi fruit, avocado and banana to increase iron absorption. Lastly, try eating meals that includes food high in iron such as pasta, liver, broccoli, tofu and red meat.

Some of the basic requirements to donate is that you have to be between 16-60 years of age, weigh at least 45kg, not have any flu in the past week or fever in the past 4 weeks. For those who have just gotten your covid-19 vaccination, you can donate 3 days after the previous dose (regardless first or second dose). For those of you who got tattoos in the past 12 months, you can only donate if the needles used are one-time sterile.

There are 4 blood banks in Singapore, at Outram(Bloodbank@HSA), Dhoby Ghaut, Woodlands Civic Center and Westgate Tower.  Do not that each blood banks will be closed on certain days of the week. Please check the operating hours of each blood bank here https://www.hsa.gov.sg/blood-donation/where-to-donate


For those who are donating for the first time, I do hope that you guys will continue donating in future. For whole blood, you guys can donate once every 84 days, or 70 days for early donation, and hence up to 4 or 5 times a year. For apheresis donation (platelets or plasma), you guys can donate once every 28 days, up to 12 or 13 times a year. Please click on the link for more info https://www.hsa.gov.sg/blood-donation/types-of-blood-donations

To sum up, donating blood is a great and meaningful way to contribute to the nation. One donation can save up to three lives! In addition, blood donation can be healthy as it helps your body to get rid of excess iron (for those with high iron levels) and your body will then produce new blood cells. https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/health-sciences/blog/surprising-health-benefits-of-donating-blood/

In addition, blood donation can be healthy as it helps your body to get rid of excess iron (for those with high iron levels) and your body will then produce new blood cells. https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/health-sciences/blog/surprising-health-benefits-of-donating-blood/

singapore,"So i got a call earlier from a guy claiming to be from AIG who was selling to me an insurance plan through phone and claiming that my profile was selected from a collab with shopee (something about a Mercedes Benz). Disclaimer: I do take part in those frivolous lucky draws.

The guy was going on about the benefits of the plan then ask if i would want to commit to enrolling for it. It was just weird (for me) to be buying insurance through phone and the guy said that he will need my credit card number but assured me its not a scam as he will not ask for my otp or cvs number (and that this is due to covid arrangement). I just rejected his offer and proceeded to call shopee hotline to verify if there were such a collab ongoing, the customer service told me no and that theres only a AIG collab w lazada (????).

I did a bit of digging and saw the last collab shopee had w AIG was back in Feb 2021.

singapore,"Hi everybody, I have a background in Artificial Intelligence and I would like to shed some light about this Phenomenon about this app.

Just a prelude, the app offers great deals such as 50 - 90% off on luxury products and gadgets such as an iPhone 12 costing as low at $699. I would caution people that too good to be true deals, even promoted by social media influencers online and The Smart Local (Harsh Dalal incident) should not be taken 100% factual.

The company aims to collect billions of data from consumers shopping behaviour all over the world to understands, predicts and influences how they shop offline. 

**Important Factors I have found**

* As someone who had used the app, I found that the navigation is very difficult to use, If you would like to look to buy the iPhone on the KaiKai app, you have to keep swiping to find it. 
* Secondly, limited functions are offered in the app, therefore, you cant do anything on the app except wait for the deal to happen at 12pm and 8pm.
Additionally, I noticed that the shop that sells the product, esp the iPhone 12 is not an official Apple shop, but a second-hand dealer shop. I have not noticed other products on where they are sold and would like to receive inputs to verify this claim that these shops might not even exist at all to sell the product at 50% below cost. 
* Lastly, when you try to reserve a product, the item sells off immediately.

**Analysis**

* As an AI company, data is king. They can use our data to find obvious and hidden findings from our behaviour in shopping. All companies would love to obtain data for free, and I strongly believe that the easiest way to apparently ""Scam"" people out of their data for free is to use the ""Time-bomb"" tactic. As explained on the difficulty of use of the app, they wanted to measure what item that are sold for a high discount is in high demand. People will ""wait"" on a particular product for the time to hit 12pm, as seen on the app, it will automatically move right after a few second which forces the user to constantly focus on the app to ensure that they dont miss the deal.
* The data collected does not explain how the data is being used. They have no terms and conditions to explain whether the data is solely being used for their own purposes, or it can be collected, used and sold to other companies (A lot of shady companies does this without being specific in their terms and condition). Looking at the description in the app store, they can track our precise location (Which allows them to decide whether location affects demand). On top of that, they have our phone number which is trackable back to us, they can find our age, address, race etc. based on this information alone. This is a major red flag that decides the consumers' demand for offline shops. 
* Shops might not exist at all, or allow the company to use their name but actually not doing the deal. I mean why would the company like 2nd hand phone shop sell a phone at 50% cost price? I would suspect they would sell a second hand phone to you even if they claimed it is brand new.

TLDR: shady company taking our data for free and Kai Kai SG is manipulating this data for their own personal use and might sell to other companies for profit. Be careful, when a deal is too good to be true, dont believe it.

I hope you guys can share this to help people be more aware of this issue.

singapore,"Hi everyone, I've been following this subreddit for a while as I am moving to Singapore from the US in a few weeks after signing a two year contract for a new job.

While I was initially so excited for this new experience, I've recently been feeling a lot of anxiety about my decision. With the three week quarantine, things shutting down, and racist reportings, I'm worried I made the wrong choice. I'm really worried I won't be able to visit my family in the US for a long time as well.

I'd really like to feel the same sense of excitement I did a few months ago, so I'd love to hear what y'all love about Singapore. Please share if you'd like!

Edit: I apologize for giving the wrong impression about my concern for racism. I understand the US is a worst place to be as a woman of color. I just meant that I've seen a lot of postings on this subreddit about racism in Singapore lately, and that coupled with other mixed feelings about the move, made me feel a certain way.

And for those asking, I'm Algerian (I have a light tan complexion). In the US, people often don't really know where I'm from by first glance, but I am not sure how my ethnicity will be understood in Singapore.","Anxiety about moving to Singapore, please tell me what to look forward to.","Hi everyone, I've been following this subreddit for a while as I am moving to Singapore from the US in a few weeks after signing a two year contract for a new job.

singapore,"Even though the current Safe Management Advisory by MOM states that:

1. All employees that can work from home must work from home

2. Companies must review work processes and utilise technology to allow those who currently cannot WFH to do so.

Very few companies seems to be adhering to these requirements strongly, even if they know MOM will Fine them for breaches upon inspection.

I don't think this is an ideological issue with ignorant and maverick managements, but rather that even if managements want to contribute to the fight against COVID, the time period given by the government makes it difficult to take WFH actions that infringe upon core business interests.

This is because our government has chosen to

A) Enforce WFH for a period of a few weeks (16 May to 13 June), with the ambiguous threat of checks, no clearly stated punishments, and the possibility of extension (which we now see)

Instead of

B) Enforce WFH for a longer period, e.g. 3 to 6 months, with the promise of a rigorous checking of all companies over the period,  clearly state that Stop Work Orders will be issued for breaches, but with the promise that the period will be cut short once the situation improves.


I think choosing A) instead of B) discourages companies from obeying the regulations by two methods, the encouragement of disobedience and the short use life of technological investments.

Encouragement of Disobedience:

Companies know that MOM's manpower is insufficient to check on every company in a 1 month period. Even if they are checked, the punishment is likely to only be a fine absorbable by the company as cost of doing business. Severe punishments like Stop Work Orders rarely occur (outside of F&amp;B) as the first punishment and are likely only enforcement upon second offense onwards. Thus it encourages businesses to risk not obeying the regulations, since they can get their act together when they need to after the first offence.

This is especially the case if they perceive other companies, especially their competitors are also thinking as such and are secretly disobeying regulations.

We may take a simple sales argument to illustrate this. In a B2B sales environment, the Sales Rep usually meets their clients in person multiple times to facilitate the Sales and process the details of the transaction, such as showing samples, arranging deliveries etc. All of this can technically be done online and hence while WFH, however the sales pitch will be less convincing and the coordination of the transaction will take longer. In an environment where the client is usually shopping around with competing services, the company that chooses to obey the regulations is likely to lose out and the company that chooses to disobey is likely to get an advantage.

This is because most clients don't really care about whether their supplier is obeying the law, only about the benefits on their side.

Thus with the low perceived cost of disobedience (possible fines) and the high perceived cost of obedience (losing clients), most businesses would choose to disobey. 

However if B) was chosen, within a 6 month time period companies would find the chance that their business would be checked more credible, and the direct risk of a first offence Stop Work Order will introduce a large incentive for obedience (as it did in F&amp;B). 

Companies would also perceive their competitors to be thinking similarly, as only a truly foolhardy competitor would risk a Stop Work Order in an environment of regular checks just to check more clients. As the entire industry is perceived to shift towards this way towards WFH friendly practices, companies don't have to worry about being undercut in the process. 

The increased risk of Stop Work Orders will also affect client side behaviours, as the small benefits of dealing with suppliers physically is likely outweighed by the high disruption risks of having a supplier be served a Stop Work Order. 


Short Use Life of Technological Investments:

Even if a company is cash rich, the cost of implementing work from home solutions is not inexpensive, especially if the existing processes are hardcopy based. 

In both time and money, the costs of shifting employees to WFH is significant, with several days of training/workplace redesign and laptop costs being the main components.

However this costs are only expensive if perceived to be useful only for 1 month, but if expected to be used for 6 months, they are quite reasonable. 

No Management Executive wants to be ""that costing centre guy"" who forces the company to spend a bunch to follow the government regulation to the letter, only for the government regulation to be relaxed soon after. 

Caveat:

However this strategy of longer periods of regulation with cutting rather than shorter periods with extensions probably is more beneficial only for business facing regulations such as WFH and other Safe Management Measures. 

For individual facing regulations such as limit on 2 people gatherings, it is probably best to do short periods with extensions, since if you announce a long ass period the population would either riot or cut back on their consumption habits so much that our economic structure gets irreparably affected.","To get more businesses to obey, Governments should announce longer WFH periods and cut back instead of shorter periods with extensions.","Even though the current Safe Management Advisory by MOM states that:

singapore,"I know this post is likely to be downvoted but I’m planning to deactivate and go off Reddit soon anyways so I really care if I lose karma. 

To start off, I’m an Indian. I wish I were Chinese when posting this because if I was whatever I say here would be taken seriously and not as “minority playing the race card again” or “minority being too sensitive” But I’m not. 

And like many many many Indians have brought up in the recent days I’ve experienced lots of racism too. And with all the discussion the recent viral incidents have brought up I finally spoke up about some of my own experiences to my Chinese friends only to get really disheartening replies. Reading the comments on the Reddit posts in this sub I feel like my head is going to explode, has Singapore always been this racist?

Because when my teachers make jokes in Chinese and the whole class but me laughs I let it be, because they’re not trying to be mean right? 

When my primary school aged brother’s friend straight up told him that he won’t talk to him because his mom said Indians are dirty I let it be, because it’s just one person right? 

During Racial Harmony day, Racial Harmony day for fucks sake, when all the Chinese kids made fun of the Indian dance routine we were made to learn I let it go because they are only insulting the dance when they say “the Indian dance is so stupid they’re just stomping their foot like a gorilla”, right?

And when they make fun of my pottu (the red dot Indian girls wear on our foreheads) I stopped wearing it, when they made fun of my smelly lunch boxes I started buying bee Hoon at the school canteen the only meal my allowance would let me afford even though I hated the taste. When they made fun of my smelly hair, of my pigtails I stopped applying coconut oil much to the distaste of my parents. I would go to school early, undo my pigtails and then go to class. And when they made fun of me for being hairy I started shaving, nicks and cuts all across my legs from buying Watson’s $2 cheap razor packs but maybe I’ll finally fit in? 

And I did, I’m 16 and I’ve spent the last decade of my life erasing as much of my Indian-ness as possible. And I have friends now! Buying food at school, getting waxed regularly, getting trendier clothes so people will think I’m cool enough to hang out with and the bottles of fairness creams, the price of my insecurities is taxing but I pay up every month without fail.

And if you met me tomorrow in real life and asked me if I’ve faced racism in Singapore I’d say “not really, there have been some instances but those are rare. It’s so much better here than in other countries. I have good friends who treat me respectfully. I’m happy being a Singaporean.” Because that’s what will get me accepted and I know that because when I say otherwise, online ofc I’m a scaredy-cat to do otherwise, I get trashed. 

It’s suffocating, it really is. Every time I hear someone say “a country will naturally cater to it’s majority, minorities demand too much” “it’s just a joke don’t make a big deal of it” “you’re being too sensitive” “stop playing the race card” “you’re just playing the victim” “stop being so dramatic” 

It hurts, it fucking hurts. Yes I don’t experience racism every single day but I do feel  painfully Indian all the time because of the racism I experience every week. Yes it’s small, it’s subtle but it’s constant. A looming remainder that you are always a lesser being always a third class citizen in this country. And I’m sick of it. 

Even as the issues we are facing gets brought to light so many are still being so insensitive and not at all emphatic to how we feel and I’m fucking sick of it. 

Why dear racists? Why? You’re Chinese you should know how it feels to be discriminated against. Anywhere outside Singapore and China youll face the same thing I do, maybe even worse with China’s recent political actions. So why the fuck are so many people still like this. 

To end off I just want to say no offence to anyone reading this. I am not saying that all Chinese people are racist or all Chinese people are bad and I am definitely not in a clam state of mind writing thins because I am positively fuming. This is an expression of pent up anger and should only be taken as such, do not take anything mentioned seriously, not that anyone cares enough to do that. It’s not your problem anyways right? I can’t expect others to be a kind person and understand my position in this issue if I myself cannot be a kind person and phrase things in a nice and kind way but you know what? I’m done being the bigger person right now I’m so sick of everything and so mad I rlly don’t care anymore. So to everyone who is going to keep doing what I mentioned here fuck you, hope you have a great time ruining more lives.


























----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit: 

So what I expected did not happen, I want to thank everyone who left a kind comment down here it really made my day (s). I cant reply to every single comment since there are so many so I just wanted to say one large collective thank you over here. Like I mentioned in this post I'm going to be taking a reddit break (not deactivating but its for o level revision and also my mental health recent as events have been really negative) I received many questions in the comments and in my dms regarding the issue of racism and I appreciate people's willingness to want to learn more about what people like me go through and how to better help us. I want to address the ""FAQ"" here before I go off just to get the word out.

""Is it still racist if malay or tamil students talk amongst themselves in malay or tamil when a chinese person is present?""
     - yes absolutely, no double standards when it comes to racism. Minorities can be racist too and if this does happen do tell the person to speak in english or translate the comments afterwards. My post only talks about Chinese people being racist because this is purely on my experiences and it just so happened that every racist attack I have gotten was from a chinese. When 70% of the population is chinese even if there is an equal proportion of racists in every race group 70% of the racists will be chinese. I am not trying to attack chinese people or imply that chinese people are the only ones who can be racist through this post. 

""Sometimes racist comments are made not out of malice but as jokes so it is important to be able to treat them as such too / see where people are coming from before labelling them as racist""
     - unconscious racists are also racists. My friends ive mentioned in this post are not being racist with the intention of hurting me, they genuinely believe it is okay and even funny to make such hurtful comments. But it isnt, they are hurtful. I know that with some really close friends otherwise problematic jokes can be made for a laugh but it is only okay with them. If you are not sure if someone is okay with you making a certain potentially hurtful joke ask them or just dont make it.

""You need to be less spineless / be more assertive / dont change yourself for them/ don't let them get to you / etc""
     - all of the sentences above say the same thing, but notice how they sound different? The first one makes me angry, as the victim in this circumstance why should I be the one who has to change myself yet again to survive? Why shouldn't the racists just stop being racist instead? But the last two comments don't make me feel this way, it feels like genuine constructive comments made to help me. 

I know that SG wont stop being racist overnight. Or even in a matter of months or years. It will probably take 1 decade + for anything to happen, assuming it does even change because the situation has been stagnant for essentially since independence. So the only real steps I can take in the near future is to be stronger myself. I know and understand this. But even though this is true, the way one says it plays a big role. By simply using different words the same piece of advice goes from something that makes me feel more alienated and demeaned to something that makes me feel cared for and welcome. 

I am not trying to over-police anyone's language. Recent trends of cancel culture and the new ""wokeness"" that is taking over the internet especially often goes too far and this has understandably created resentment in people who are tired of constantly being afraid of being cancelled or attacked because they said something out of line. I am not trying to do that, I am merely telling everyone to be more kind in your word choices especially with people who have endured decades of negativity which has conditioned them to assume the worst of anything that sounds even slightly condescending. 

I also want to bring one more point forward, this advice is clearly easier said than done. I am not saying that everyone who gave me this advice down in the comments are racist to give it because many seemed to have kind and good intentions and most of the comments were phrased positively but I just want to remind everyone that its hard to follow this. Some minority race Singaporeans may be good at this but that does not mean everyone can do it because introverts, shy people, naturally submissive people, etc do exist. Just because you or someone you know personally finds it easy doesnt mean it is easy so whilst you give this advice do be understanding if the person receiving it is unable to follow it. In any case we shouldn't be in a position where we need to be strong or be shut down.

""kids are imature and just mean liddat, this will stop when when they older""
     - I am 16 hence my daily life revolves around kids. But I have experienced racism from adults too be it eg. someone moving away when i sit at the same hawker centre table as them when they were perfectly fine with other chinese people sitting with them (im vegetarian so my food doesn't even smell bad, cant give the smelly fish excuse) I wont go into each and every situation because there are too many and I cant even remember most of them off the top of my head (if someone asked you to list every fun outing youve been on for instance you wont be able to rattle them off all in one go, this is like that. And this isnt because the incidents weren't scarring enough or too trivial least anyone misunderstands)

Moreover, kids learn from somewhere. Some people say kids are naturally mean they are just making fun of random things this is not motivated by racism. And I just want to go off a tangent and say this is the comment I hate the most. Even those who tell me im too sensitive acknowledge that what they said isnt 100% okay. But you here dont even do that much. The very very very bare minimum one can do is call a racist incident a racist incident. If you cant even afford me that much consideration for me you are truly a spawn of hell (trying very hard not to cuss here) So back to the question, maybe someone saying ""you're hairy"" might be a kid just being mean. But someone saying ""eew why are indians so hairy"" is no longer that. This connection ones makes between a race and a feeling of disgust is not natural, they definitely a) heard it from someone or b) came up with it themselves and nobody corrected them. ""You are fat"" is a kid being mean, ""ahponeneh"" is not. Yes kids are mean because they have no filter, but that does not mean that they are not racist and that adults are not racist. 

Going of on another tangent here but kids should not be allowed to be mean to start off with. if your child is calling people fat or ugly they may not be racist but that does not mean it is okay or excusable. On top of kids being regular mean they also pick up racist stereotypes and terms from their parents who care about their reputation enough to not go screaming this out to every person they see on the streets. But both the kid and the parent are racist and they might think that nobody will know nobody gets hurt but they are wrong, we feel it, we know. 


Closing note: My original post was an anger rant. I didnt use the best words to explain the situation, i didnt even correct my grammer my english teacher is going to be so disappointed lol. But i am not going to edit it because I still stand by what I said there. However, I want to add in a more calm and better phrased appeal here because nobody all the non-racist chinese people did not deserve to read through all that thoughtless bashing, if I was in thier place I would not have liked it too much. 

We all know racism is very prevalent at this point, no need to say that again. But what I want to say is, what seems small never is. It hurts a lot, really. It might be just one moment, just one sentence when someone makes you feel unwelcome and even I myself might forget it temporarily but the memory shows up every time i see another chinese person and I wonder ""are they thinking the same?"" The scars constantly weigh you down. Another story because what better way to share how you feel; as a kid i stepped on this little boy's finger on accident when he was sitting down at the playground. He started wailing, his mother rushes over and chides the boy ""didn't I tell you not to play with the Indians"" She gives me a glare I'll never forget, its the kind of glare that says a lot at once. She continues admonishing the boy for his ""mistake"" in chinese, I didnt know chinese but I knew exactly what she was saying because that glare said it all. I never forget, I dont think I can ever forget. And till today I admit I never go to the birthday parties of my chinese friends, even those who treat me well, because I am terrified that her parents will hate me too. Its illogical, I know. Its one random crazy lady who was like that, I know. But when I did step into a chinese house to work on a project nothing more I felt the fear. The need to hide, the need to get away. So please think twice both before you speak and before you choose to stay silent when someone else speaks this way.

""It will die off with the boomers""
     - 90% of my examples i the original post was about kids so idk what to say about this. Plenty of 20-15 year olds are racist too. I know this because that's usually the age group of the uni mentors we get assigned for certain competitions and man they are not nice. (eg; i was going to record voiceover, mentor told me to stop and ask my Chinese friend to record because my accent is ""funny"" and the judges may not like it""     other eg: i was volunteering and was about to record a video displaying the products we are selling for charity. In one of the clips i held the product in my hand and spun it around to show all sides (this was for instagram to promote the sale) and mentor comes up tells me to not show my hands cuz im brown and its ""not as nice""   can list more examples but fingers hurt already and this is already very tldr haha, point is its not just the boomers. More common in the boomers but younger generations are being very openly racist too)",I’m so sick of it,"I know this post is likely to be downvoted but I’m planning to deactivate and go off Reddit soon anyways so I really care if I lose karma.

I am not saying that all Chinese people are racist or all Chinese people are bad and I am definitely not in a clam state of mind writing thins because I am positively fuming. This is an expression of pent up anger and should only be taken as such, do not take anything mentioned seriously, not that anyone cares enough to do that. It’s not your problem anyways right? I can’t expect others to be a kind person and understand my position in this issue if I myself cannot be a kind person and phrase things in a nice and kind way but you know what? I’m done being the bigger person right now I’m so sick of everything and so mad I rlly don’t care anymore. So to everyone who is going to keep doing what I mentioned here fuck you, hope you have a great time ruining more lives.


























----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit: 

So what I expected did not happen, I want to thank everyone who left a kind comment down here it really made my day (s). I cant reply to every single comment since there are so many so I just wanted to say one large collective thank you over here. Like I mentioned in this post I'm going to be taking a reddit break (not deactivating but its for o level revision and also my mental health recent as events have been really negative) I received many questions in the comments and in my dms regarding the issue of racism and I appreciate people's willingness to want to learn more about what people like me go through and how to better help us. I want to address the ""FAQ"" here before I go off just to get the word out.

""Is it still racist if malay or tamil students talk amongst themselves in malay or tamil when a chinese person is present?""
     - yes absolutely, no double standards when it comes to racism. Minorities can be racist too and if this does happen do tell the person to speak in english or translate the comments afterwards. My post only talks about Chinese people being racist because this is purely on my experiences and it just so happened that every racist attack I have gotten was from a chinese. When 70% of the population is chinese even if there is an equal proportion of racists in every race group 70% of the racists will be chinese. I am not trying to attack chinese people or imply that chinese people are the only ones who can be racist through this post. 

""Sometimes racist comments are made not out of malice but as jokes so it is important to be able to treat them as such too / see where people are coming from before labelling them as racist""
     - unconscious racists are also racists. My friends ive mentioned in this post are not being racist with the intention of hurting me, they genuinely believe it is okay and even funny to make such hurtful comments. But it isnt, they are hurtful. I know that with some really close friends otherwise problematic jokes can be made for a laugh but it is only okay with them. If you are not sure if someone is okay with you making a certain potentially hurtful joke ask them or just dont make it.

""You need to be less spineless / be more assertive / dont change yourself for them/ don't let them get to you / etc""
     - all of the sentences above say the same thing, but notice how they sound different? The first one makes me angry, as the victim in this circumstance why should I be the one who has to change myself yet again to survive? Why shouldn't the racists just stop being racist instead? But the last two comments don't make me feel this way, it feels like genuine constructive comments made to help me. 

I know that SG wont stop being racist overnight. Or even in a matter of months or years. It will probably take 1 decade + for anything to happen, assuming it does even change because the situation has been stagnant for essentially since independence. So the only real steps I can take in the near future is to be stronger myself. I know and understand this. But even though this is true, the way one says it plays a big role. By simply using different words the same piece of advice goes from something that makes me feel more alienated and demeaned to something that makes me feel cared for and welcome. 

I am not trying to over-police anyone's language. Recent trends of cancel culture and the new ""wokeness"" that is taking over the internet especially often goes too far and this has understandably created resentment in people who are tired of constantly being afraid of being cancelled or attacked because they said something out of line. I am not trying to do that, I am merely telling everyone to be more kind in your word choices especially with people who have endured decades of negativity which has conditioned them to assume the worst of anything that sounds even slightly condescending. 

I also want to bring one more point forward, this advice is clearly easier said than done. I am not saying that everyone who gave me this advice down in the comments are racist to give it because many seemed to have kind and good intentions and most of the comments were phrased positively but I just want to remind everyone that its hard to follow this. Some minority race Singaporeans may be good at this but that does not mean everyone can do it because introverts, shy people, naturally submissive people, etc do exist. Just because you or someone you know personally finds it easy doesnt mean it is easy so whilst you give this advice do be understanding if the person receiving it is unable to follow it. In any case we shouldn't be in a position where we need to be strong or be shut down.

""kids are imature and just mean liddat, this will stop when when they older""
     - I am 16 hence my daily life revolves around kids. But I have experienced racism from adults too be it eg. someone moving away when i sit at the same hawker centre table as them when they were perfectly fine with other chinese people sitting with them (im vegetarian so my food doesn't even smell bad, cant give the smelly fish excuse) I wont go into each and every situation because there are too many and I cant even remember most of them off the top of my head (if someone asked you to list every fun outing youve been on for instance you wont be able to rattle them off all in one go, this is like that. And this isnt because the incidents weren't scarring enough or too trivial least anyone misunderstands)

Moreover, kids learn from somewhere. Some people say kids are naturally mean they are just making fun of random things this is not motivated by racism. And I just want to go off a tangent and say this is the comment I hate the most. Even those who tell me im too sensitive acknowledge that what they said isnt 100% okay. But you here dont even do that much. The very very very bare minimum one can do is call a racist incident a racist incident. If you cant even afford me that much consideration for me you are truly a spawn of hell (trying very hard not to cuss here) So back to the question, maybe someone saying ""you're hairy"" might be a kid just being mean. But someone saying ""eew why are indians so hairy"" is no longer that. This connection ones makes between a race and a feeling of disgust is not natural, they definitely a) heard it from someone or b) came up with it themselves and nobody corrected them. ""You are fat"" is a kid being mean, ""ahponeneh"" is not. Yes kids are mean because they have no filter, but that does not mean that they are not racist and that adults are not racist. 

Going of on another tangent here but kids should not be allowed to be mean to start off with. if your child is calling people fat or ugly they may not be racist but that does not mean it is okay or excusable. On top of kids being regular mean they also pick up racist stereotypes and terms from their parents who care about their reputation enough to not go screaming this out to every person they see on the streets. But both the kid and the parent are racist and they might think that nobody will know nobody gets hurt but they are wrong, we feel it, we know. 


Closing note: My original post was an anger rant. I didnt use the best words to explain the situation, i didnt even correct my grammer my english teacher is going to be so disappointed lol. But i am not going to edit it because I still stand by what I said there. However, I want to add in a more calm and better phrased appeal here because nobody all the non-racist chinese people did not deserve to read through all that thoughtless bashing, if I was in thier place I would not have liked it too much. 

We all know racism is very prevalent at this point, no need to say that again. But what I want to say is, what seems small never is. It hurts a lot, really. It might be just one moment, just one sentence when someone makes you feel unwelcome and even I myself might forget it temporarily but the memory shows up every time i see another chinese person and I wonder ""are they thinking the same?"" The scars constantly weigh you down. Another story because what better way to share how you feel; as a kid i stepped on this little boy's finger on accident when he was sitting down at the playground. He started wailing, his mother rushes over and chides the boy ""didn't I tell you not to play with the Indians"" She gives me a glare I'll never forget, its the kind of glare that says a lot at once. She continues admonishing the boy for his ""mistake"" in chinese, I didnt know chinese but I knew exactly what she was saying because that glare said it all. I never forget, I dont think I can ever forget. And till today I admit I never go to the birthday parties of my chinese friends, even those who treat me well, because I am terrified that her parents will hate me too. Its illogical, I know. Its one random crazy lady who was like that, I know. But when I did step into a chinese house to work on a project nothing more I felt the fear. The need to hide, the need to get away. So please think twice both before you speak and before you choose to stay silent when someone else speaks this way.

""It will die off with the boomers""
     - 90% of my examples i the original post was about kids so idk what to say about this. Plenty of 20-15 year olds are racist too. I know this because that's usually the age group of the uni mentors we get assigned for certain competitions and man they are not nice. (eg; i was going to record voiceover, mentor told me to stop and ask my Chinese friend to record because my accent is ""funny"" and the judges may not like it""     other eg: i was volunteering and was about to record a video displaying the products we are selling for charity. In one of the clips i held the product in my hand and spun it around to show all sides (this was for instagram to promote the sale) and mentor comes up tells me to not show my hands cuz im brown and its ""not as nice""   can list more examples but fingers hurt already and this is already very tldr haha, point is its not just the boomers. More common in the boomers but younger generations are being very openly racist too) I’m so sick of it"

singapore,"The past few days or the past weeks, there have been a few discussions about the Lions' result, performance. So, just want to create this post for a casual discussion, on how to improve Singapore's football. Is it possible?

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I am not in football industry and am not involved in local football scene. I am just following Europe football casually. I seldom follow Singapore football, or SEA football. So, obviously I am just an armchair critic. The following are just a few points I can think of, with research using my Googleful skills.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Coaching - I have read in previous discussion that our local, grassroot coaching is like dinosaur, outdated, which I believe so. We should really send out football coaches, especially youth level coaches, to overseas, attached so some local clubs there, to learn their way of coaching, especially coaching at youth level. There is no need top level clubs, a proper division 1 or 2 club is good enough I think. Or, if Europe is out of budget, how about Japan or Korea? There much be a reason they are football powerhouse of Asia now, and our body build is actually closer to them, than the angmohs. Send our coaches there, by batches. How about 2 for 1 or 2 years? Learn how they coach the players skill wise, tactic wise, ect.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Professional football - I sincerely feel that, we should scrap our S Premier League. We are only this big, with this mauch population, and not everyone follow football, even less will attend football matches. Every club can only have this many supporters. Why our clubs have to rely on subsidies from FAS, or their game machines to make money? The organic income from fan based or sponsors are just not enough. There is no need to have ego here. Why not collaborate with Malaysia, or Indonesia, or Thai leagues? We have 2 or at most 3 clubs to join in their leagues. We can consolidate the resources, gather the good players to form 2, 3 teams, for good football. By joining their leagues, we allow our players to be exposed to SEA league standards, another way to improve them. Also, when teams in their leagues come here for our home matches, I am sure there will be Thais, or Indonesians, or Malaysians in Singapore who are willing to attend matches to support their home countries' clubs. When our players show that they are good, they can make it in the region, naturally clubs in these leagues will want to recruit them. This is another way to have income the clubs.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Grassroot football - Establish more grassroot football league, competitions. This is not necessary to be at school levels (we cannot rely on schools here because there are schools, principal who are just not interested in this activity). This can be independent grassroot football clubs, maybe affiliated to pro clubs, maybe not. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Neutralised citizens - I actually think long and hard regarding this. We are not new to this idea. We did that before and I still remember kena laughed by my Malaysian friends some of the national players were not born Singapore citizens, like Qiu Li, Mustafic, Duric. Seems like we stopped this practice for some time. Is it time we revisit this again? I checked our current squad. Can safely say that they are all born Singaporean. Are there better foreign players in SPL who are eligible? Someone actually created a very good WIki list here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Singapore\_footballers\_born\_outside\_Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Singapore_footballers_born_outside_Singapore). Is this still something that not accepted now? Maybe we or FAS should actively looking out, for half Singaporeans (whose father or mother is Singapore but himself is not) who play professional football in other countries/leagues? Malaysia has a few such players, even Thai also has. And, surprisingly, Malaysia also has 3 neutralised players, 1 from Brazil, 1 from Kosovo, and 1 from Gambia (family moved to Malaysia since he was 12). Thailand has 1 half Thai from France, 1 half Thai from Germany and 1 from Spain (after years in Thai League). Philippines gives me a big shock. I know they started recruited half Pinoy players from overseas years ago (still remember the Younghusband brothers, from Chelsea FC), but I am shocked that they went this far now. In their current squad, they have 6 players from Germany, 3 players from Spain, 3 from US, 2 from Swiss, 1 from Canada, 1 from England, 1 born in UAE but grew up in England, 1 from Japan, 1 from Netherland and 1 from Denmark, only 3 are natively from Philippines. Some of the players were half Pinoy, some were total angmohs before neutralisation. Do we want to go this far? Personally I don't like it. I think, other than leisure, football should give kids hope, hope that they can represent their country. Pinoy redditors and football followers who happen to read this post, mind sharing what your thought regarding this? 

&amp;#x200B;

5. Stamina - someone mentioned that, stamina of current batch of players cannot make it. I can't comment on that. But having excellent stamina is a must. Techincally, Park Ji Sung is not the most gifted, but he had excellent stamina, he just keep running and running and running throughout the 90 minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a Zoom interview with a prestigious childcare(MapleBear). I applied as an English Teacher. After a 20min discussion, the centre director asked me if I am okay to remove my hijab for work. When questioned why and she said because the school has a uniform code to follow to. 

Hijab has been an issue in Singapore for a long time, and normally associated with nurses and uniform groups. But preschool teacher? I have never known for it to be an issue in this industry. Most preschools (I honestly thought all) allow teachers to wear their hijabs with their uniforms. 

My hijab has never been in my way to educate the young ones, and I am sure it is the same for any other hijabi teacher. I am angry that an organisation that has so much to do with childrens' outlook of life themselves hold such backward policies.

Update : the centre director actually emailed me and called me to say that hijab is not her main consideration factor and asked if I am okay with the other stuff so she can forward my application to the management. When I asked then why was it even brought up, she said that oh she was just asking, she wants to know what the applicant would come to work wearing. 

She asked if I thought that she was rejecting me because of the hijab, and I said yup sure felt that way. So she said oh no I have malay friends and colleagues... So yes here's an update not sure if it was really a misunderstanding on my part or there are reasons she suddenly changed her tone.

singapore,"(The below words are from Ms. Kokila Annamalai, a fellow Singaporean Tamil, about her thoughts on recent happenings, and a call out to our majority non-racist Singapore Chinese friends to stand up and be counted)


It's difficult to explain why amongst so many acts of racist aggression and staggering hostility that we have all borne witness to lately, this one made me come undone. Is it the desecration of the prayer bell, that is a sound of great comfort, peace and transcendence? Is it because this is the same bell that our friends rang with love at my wedding? Is it that our brother in the video continues his ritual seamlessly, so composed and self-possessed, refusing to recoil or shrink away from this shameful bullying? Is it because once again, this hostility was displayed by a neighbour, and I too have felt deeply unsettled in my own home because of neighbours' racist behaviours? Because so many of us work so hard to make our homes a sanctuary we can retreat to, away from an often alienating and harsh world, but are reminded that this, too, cannot be ours? Or is it because it comes on the back of so many other incidents that have made me and every other Indian person I know more nervous on public transport or walking down the street?

If I had to put my finger on one reason, though, I think it would be this - I can see her face in the video. I can see the unmasked hatred, the mocking expression, the contempt, the disgust, the spite, the vindictiveness. In her face, I see how she planned this, how all this anger has been festering in her, how she got her prop ready and took time out of her day to disrupt this family's sacred practice, and let them know just how much she detests them and their practices.

In her face, I see all the ""apuneneh""s and ""keling-kia""s that children screamed in our faces, all the impatient Chinese shop owners who ""tsk"" at us, who bark ""what you want?"" at us, I see every time my friends and I have been made to feel like pests, I see the woman who spat at me and my lover on a train, I see the source of the shame I know we have all felt about the intimate, beautiful things our families, cultures and lands have given us - our coconut oil, our pottu, our incense, our kuzhambus (or curries, to you), the way our tongues rolls, our dark skin, the dance numbers in our films, our deities, our bells. 

In her face, I see the root of why so many Tamil folks in Singapore distance themselves from anything that could attract taunting and derision from their Chinese peers, including each other. Because what won't we give, so that someone never looks at us that way? Too much. Enough to lead to an existential loneliness later in life, a yearning that cannot be fulfilled. 

Racial contempt taints everything. I know because I know that the sounds of gongs, cymbals and drums that accompany lion dance - sounds of familiarity I have always relished, even when they awaken me too early on a Sunday morning - will now always remind me of this woman, and her face full of hatred. 

What solidarity means, is for Chinese people - perhaps other neighbours, friends of Livanesh/his family, but best of all, friends/family of this woman - to reach out to Livanesh, ask him what he and his family need, and offer to speak to this woman and her family. To then support this woman in acknowledging the harm of her actions, and hold herself accountable to putting things right. To explore with her what factors in her environment allowed her to believe she could act in such a manner, and commit to transforming those conditions. 

Livanesh's family deserves to live and practice their faith in peace, and live as equals among their neighbours. They deserve to receive an unconditional apology and amends - whatever that looks like to them - for the disrespect and bullying they've been subject to. And Chinese people who consider themselves anti-racist - this is an invitation to step up and take responsibility for trying to make this happen.

We - especially Chinese people, but in fact all of us - might feel release in making this woman out to be a monster, setting ourselves apart from her. But the much more difficult, scary and transformative work, is in recognising her ordinariness. In recognising that these monstrosities lurk everywhere, within all of us to some extent, and we need each other to exorcise them.","A letter to our beloved Singapore Chinese - with pain, tears, hope for love and solidarity","(The below words are from Ms. Kokila Annamalai, a fellow Singaporean Tamil, about her thoughts on recent happenings, and a call out to our majority non-racist Singapore Chinese friends to stand up and be counted)

singapore,"With most of us staying at home and looking for new hobbies, I have chanced upon a particular craft that is relatively easy to do. STRING ART. Initially, I did a quick google search for a kit and most shipped from the US so I decided to assemble the kit myself. 

You will need
- Wooden Board
This was hard to find since the craft requires a thick board(1/2 inch) to ensure that the nail can be hammered in properly. Resorted to using a thinner board from Daiso with smaller nails.

- Nails
Bought a pack from a local hardware store and man it was expensive for a small pack(I admit I didn’t compare prices before I bought since I was so excited) 

I then decided to buy the nails form Shopee as a bulk purchase which was much cheaper

- Embroidery Floss
Courtesy of Shopee as well. I will recommend buying a few spools of the common colours 

That’s all! The basic idea is 
1. Print a design you like
2. Paste this on the wooden board(use scotch tape)
3. Hammer nails along the outline of the design
4. Tear the printed paper from the board
5. Use the embroidery floss to randomly loop around the nails to finish the design 

It was very relaxing to do but I’ll say keep the hammering of the nails during the daytime to ensure that your neighbours don’t get disturbed

singapore,"Disclaimer: I am a Chinese non-SAP school student who attended a Catholic girl's school, IP girl's secondary/JC. My mother/brother were SAP school students who tried to get me into Peichun and Aitong but couldn't, hence I eventually ended up making more Indian and Malay friends than they have. It is my observation that they generally do not mix with non-Chinese much and hold certain misconceptions (e.g. my brother once asked if my JC has very few pure Malays since he thinks smart Malays usually intermarry)

1. Do SAP school students still encounter very few Malays, Indians and Eurasians during their primary and secondary years? Does this affect how SAP school students view society? e.g. the Hwachong lady felt threatened enough to video record non-Chinese folks she meets in public.

2. Why does MOE support an educational policy where traditional Chinese values are taught but not traditional Indian or Malay values? Why teach only traditional Chinese values over Singaporean values, does this not propagate the ideology of racial elitism especially since some local Chinese already believe Chinese are superior as the majority race in Singapore and ""China #1""? (At my university in UK I knew a few Hwachong/HCI/NYGH students who were obssessed with Kpop to the point of learning Korean so they could work in Korea, and I was told their schools encouraged East Asian pop media over English pop.)

3. Shouldn't all primary/secondary schools get equal funding to teach traditional cultural values in order to foster racial harmony, not just SAP schools? Isn't that fairer and less elitist, shouldn't all students regardless of background and race get that funding instead of selective students of mostly Chinese origin? 

It takes time to change innate human psychological preferences for one's own race. **Exclusionary SAP schools do the opposite of reinforcing a mindset to prefer one's own race in children's developmental years, as long as they aren't inclusive, racism will continue to exist in Singapore**. When I was 6 my mother told me SAP schools get additional funding so it was best that I attend one, when I couldn't make Phase C she was disappointed but my time at a Catholic girls school was excellent, and I studied among many Chinese, Eurasian, Malay and Indian girls. Truth is, I only started warming up to making non-Chinese best friends in secondary school and JC, I was too shy in primary school but without my primary school experience I wouldn't have had the confidence to befriend non-Chinese people closely as I got older.","Sensitive Discussion: Are SAP schools necessary to teach ""traditional Chinese values"" in Singapore, and do they foster a learning environment where racial elitism can be subtly instilled among students?","Disclaimer: I am a Chinese non-SAP school student who attended a Catholic girl's school, IP girl's secondary/JC. My mother/brother were SAP school students who tried to get me into Peichun and Aitong but couldn't, hence I eventually ended up making more Indian and Malay friends than they have. It is my observation that they generally do not mix with non-Chinese much and hold certain misconceptions (e.g. my brother once asked if my JC has very few pure Malays since he thinks smart Malays usually intermarry)

1. Do SAP school students still encounter very few Malays, Indians and Eurasians during their primary and secondary years? Does this affect how SAP school students view society? e.g. the Hwachong lady felt threatened enough to video record non-Chinese folks she meets in public.

2. Why does MOE support an educational policy where traditional Chinese values are taught but not traditional Indian or Malay values?

singapore,"I would like to preface this by saying this is obviously just my opinion, and comments are always welcome. Please feel free to correct my mistakes or lack of understanding lol.

So recently I had a big argument with my mom about the safety of mRNA vaccines, and how they would supposedly cause “blood clots” and “reproductive issues” 10-20 years down the road. Young people will supposedly die en masse because of these “Western vaccines”. If these arguments sound familiar, it is because they are some of the [most common bad faith arguments propagated online by countries such as China and Russia](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russia-china-sow-disinformation-to-undermine-trust-in-western-vaccines-eu-report-says) in a bid to promote their own vaccines while also trying (and succeeding) in sowing doubt and discord.

Of course, the 12 doctors expressing their opinions on that matter did not help things at all, and only served to cause more confusion around the matter. Now with the expert opinions on her side, she reasoned that the mRNA vaccine is therefore not safe for young kids, and no amount of persuasion will cause her to change her mind. So if you are one of the 12 doctors reading this, I hope you are happy, because I sure am not.

Now you might laugh and say, haha boomers am I right, but the truth is that this is a result of years of psychological warfare by adversarial states around us. In this instance, I will focus mostly on the Chinese medium, but this will still apply even if you are of other races or religions.

First of all, most of these misinformation are spread in Chinese, through platforms such as WeChat and WhatsApp where our government seems to have basically no control over. Case in point, there has yet to be a single POFMA notice listed on the platforms above, while we have had multiple on HWZ, Facebook and Twitter, which seems to limit the efficacy of such measures. I would assume that many of the folks at MCI don’t seem to use the Chinese platforms much, because why would they?

The other problem is that our only broadsheet (yes Wanbao and Shin Min don’t count) Chinese newspaper Zaobao seems to have done an exceptionally poor job of trying to dispel such rumours. [Many of such articles are hidden behind paywalls](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/singapore/story20210608-1153257), and are relatively sparse in information as compared to the ones you might find on ST or CNA. [Some articles like this](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/old-is-not-always-gold-and-other-drug-safety-myths) and opinion pieces are also not translated, and unsurprisingly this vacuum is being filled with all the trash articles online on the platforms I listed above.

I have found that older people tend to only remember the last few articles they read and base their opinions on those. However, we cannot deny that [Chinese standards for the younger generation have obviously fallen off a cliff](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/more-local-chinese-speaking-english-their-main-language-singapore-losing-bilingual-edge-pm), and given our small population there was no way in hell we would be able to compete and churn out articles fast enough to keep up the ever-increasing deluge of information. Of course, there are other contributing factors, like the sheer number of PRs handed out a few years ago, but I will leave that for another time.

So now we have a group of people who are anti-vaxx, or at the very least do not trust “western vaccines” because “Sinovac is superior”, where do we go from here? For one, POFMA must start getting enforced more frequently, and on more platforms, specifically those owned by Chinese companies. Good thing Tencent and Bytedance both have offices here, and I suppose a cup of tea/kopi with the executives at Cantonment can’t hurt… (I kid, I kid.)

Zaobao also need to do a better job and stop putting vital articles behind the damn paywall. Save those for celebrity gossip BS, I’m sure there are people who will pay for that. Of course, now that SPH is wholly owned by the government, I expect things to change…

More online media outlets are also needed, as they tend to be much more flexible and attuned to the ground per say. For all the hate thrown towards Mothership(yes you guys may copy my homework), I guess it is preferable to having none and letting foreign countries dictate what we read.

**TLDR**: China vaccine misinformation too powerful, experts start to contradict one another, nobody knows how WeChat works and Zaobao is useless.

Other news outlets are not allowed to link to this without permission. I'm looking at you TOC.

EDIT: Obviously I am not saying that you should blindly trust western media, we all know how biased CNN and Fox News can be, Bush's WMD and Trump are in fact BS. But instead we should be looking at why a certain article is published, what is the call to action, and what emotions it is supposed to make us feel. Ask if their goals and actions are aligned to ours. Only then can we start making informed choices.

&amp;#x200B;

Just want to share my very unpleasant experience I had with the official Samsung store on Shopee Mall and the service staff ""arrowing"" responsibility for not checking properly.

Recently I ordered a Tab S6 **Lite** from the Samsung official store during a Shopee promotion with a free gift of a matching keyboard case cover (see image below). The price was slightly higher than other resellers with warranty however I got it because of the free keyboard that came along with the promo.

https://preview.redd.it/3ha8bkh2n8471.png?width=1241&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf819be30124a04e9e48a1cfc33268e5d4e74af0

And when the product arrived, I realized that Samsung had sent a keyboard cover that wasn't working on arrival. I didn't though much about it &amp; went down to booked an appointment with Samsung service centre to get a replacement for the keyboard. 

  
However, when I was at the service centre and asked to replace the keyboard, the staff told me it was working, just that I got a version that was incompatible with my S6 **Lite** tablet and there was nothing they could do about it. I showed them my Shopee purchase where they confirmed with me the promo listed an incompatible keyboard, however, I indeed got the right keyboard as listed in the GWP but they were unwilling to commit any black &amp; white to help me explain to the Shopee team. 

  
I then contacted the Samsung official shop on Shopee Mall about the wrong keyboard as part of the GWP promo only for the staff to tell me that they don't have any keyboard cover for S6 Lite &amp; had unknowingly &amp; 'unintentionally' set up the wrong promo details. (Because they Samsung Official themselves thought it would work or something??).   
Samsung shopee mall then confirmed that they can't do a replacement as they didn't have any stocks of keyboard for my tablet but they were willing to compensate my $238 [keyboard cover](https://shopee.sg/Samsung-Tab-S6-Keyboard-cover-i.163341072.7242275512) (mods: pls remove the link if it is not allowed) with a $48 [smarttag](https://shopee.sg/-GWP-Samsung-Galaxy-SmartTag-i.163341072.6388474957).

It is just so disappointing that the Samsung shop on shopee don't even know their products well enough to bundle the correct accessories for their own devices &amp; now the fault falls on the consumers to double-check whether they listed the right products.   
What I just wanted was an accessory for WFH and hence keyboard for faster inputs however all they are willing to commit for this blunder was a smart-tag (to track my tablet that will never leave the house?).  
Don't end up like me and just assume the free promo gift works, just assist them in checking their own products since they themselves don't even know better.

singapore,"I’ve been living in Singapore for the past year (arrived in March 2020, and leaving for good in 2 months) and had the chance to really try out the food scene (mostly international) that Singapore has to offer.

Before I came here, a friend made me a list of restaurants that I had to try out, and things I had to do, and for the first few months of living here that list was what I consistently referred to. Well after being here for the past year, I’ve managed to compile some of my favorites/worthy mentions and made a what I like to call my “hall of fame” of different food categories and things to do in Singapore. This list has just been piling up in my notes, so I thought I’ll share this here so you can hopefully find your next go-to place or you can recommend me some of your favorites!

(someone count how many times i say “good” and “nice” in this,, wow i’m so descriptive)",My “Best of Singapore” list after trying a different restaurant every week for a year,"I’ve been living in Singapore for the past year (arrived in March 2020, and leaving for good in 2 months) and had the chance to really try out the food scene (mostly international) that Singapore has to offer.

Before I came here, a friend made me a list of restaurants that I had to try out, and things I had to do, and for the first few months of living here that list was what I consistently referred to. Well after being here for the past year, I’ve managed to compile some of my favorites/worthy mentions and made a what I like to call my “hall of fame” of different food categories and things to do in Singapore. This list has just been piling up in my notes, so I thought I’ll share this here so you can hopefully find your next go-to place or you can recommend me some of your favorites! 

(also inspired by a previous post I saw on here by @u/Sk8tr_Boi) 

**Hawker/Local food $**
- Hawker Chan - really good QQ noodles (skip the char xiu and ask for roasted chicken thigh and xiu yuk)

- Ah Chiew’s Dessert (for old school desserts, real good Mango Sago) 
- Ah Di Durian @ Dempsey (kinda hard to locate, have to call to book in advance, but real good durian)

TL;DR: We made an app to help people organise and join group takeaways easily. It’s been a year in the making (since the previous CB actually), and we finally feel like it’s at a point where we’re happy to put more publicity around it.

**Wait.. didn’t you post this a few days ago?**

3 hours after making the post, we made the grave mistake of adding a link to our app's Facebook page… and it got auto removed by the bot. Oops.

**What is a KopiRun?**

A KopiRun (like coffee run, hur hur) is an offer to take additional orders on your way to get stuff. For example, if I’m about to go out and get bubble tea, I’d use the app to broadcast to my HDB/Condo to get additional cups for a small extra fee, maybe $1. People near you would get notified, and can place their orders via the app too.

If you’re going to get food from a hawker store, please especially consider placing a KopiRun offer. As mentioned in [this podcast](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/podcasts/heart-of-the-matter/covid-hawker-food-centre-open-dabao-delivery-app-payment-culture-14939692), many hawkers out there aren’t on delivery apps and this could really help them get more business. 

If you’re a merchant and you organise your own delivery, you can also benefit from KopiRun. If you’re going to deliver something at say Pasir Ris, make a KopiRun at the same location to get any additional orders from people there and make your trip more worthwhile.

**What KopiRun will let you do:**

* Place KopiRuns on your way out, set a meetup location and time. You can choose to accept or decline orders.
* Get notified if someone’s KopiRun meetup point is near you, and join a KopiRun.
* Chat feature within the app.

**Our ask:**

This app is more useful when there’s a large number of people close by using the app. We’d really appreciate it if you could share with family/friends in your household, apartment, University hall, etc.

**Thanks to:**

Our lovely beta testers (family and friends), and the people at [Foodleh](https://www.foodleh.app/) for their feedback and ideas - go check them out too!

One Final Note: we don’t collect any middleman fee/admin fee, so bear in mind that by using the app you’re using it at your own risk (i.e., if things go bad and someone cancels when you’ve already bought). We're looking at additional mechanisms to prevent this.

singapore,"Honest question, how do people affected by this feel? 

For context - everyone that is not a Singapore citizen but resident (PR, EP, DP holders etc - a group of millions of people) will have a delay of weeks (if not months) to get vaccinated.

singapore,"Outward Bound Singapore recently announced the beginning of construction of a new campus on Coney Island. This has prompted quite a number of Singaporeans to question OBS, including the effects of the construction on the ecosystem on Coney Island.

OBS has claimed that doing so is a ""necessary expansion of our campuses to accommodate all Secondary 3 students for their once in a lifetime OBS experience"".

**I say that's pure horsesh\*t.**

Why such an environmentally valuable location like Coney Island?

And how can we trust that the process will be ""carefully planned"", given that the recent gaffe where [4.5ha of Kranji woodland was cleared ""erroneously"" under site developer JTC Corporation](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/how-the-unauthorised-clearing-of-kranji-woodland-happened) is still relatively fresh in our minds?

True, the masterplan to have all secondary 3 students attend a five-day OBS camp was only implemented in 2020, so I can understand that there's a need for OBS to expand its current capacities to meet the surge in demand.

But again, really, Coney Island?

Not to mention that our birth rates have been falling anyway. Dozens of primary schools, secondary schools, and junior colleges have merged in the past decade. [Five more pairs of secondary schools are set to merge between 2022 and 2024.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/moe-schools-merging-new-town-tanglin-telok-kurau-14573328) The surge in demand from the recent implementation of the masterplan will surely wane in the near future, and I really don't know if building a new OBS campus at a location like Coney Island is really worth it. 

There are many alternatives. For one, there are many vacated and empty compounds just standing around - I'm sure you've seen some of them - that could be repurposed.

singapore,"Covid-19 sequencing in Singapore has revealed the emergence of the delta variant as the country’s major local virus strain, underscoring the highly infectious nature of the mutation that has proliferated globally since its first detection in India.

Of these cases as of May 31, 449 have been found to be caused by variants of concern, among which 428 were infections of the delta strain, said the country’s health ministry. The next largest group was nine cases linked to the beta mutation that first emerged in South Africa.

The “current understanding” is that some variants, including the delta mutation, “are more transmissible,” a spokesperson for Singapore’s health ministry said on Tuesday in a response to questions from Bloomberg News. “Studies are ongoing to get a more complete understanding of these variants and we will adjust our strategies as more information is made available.”

Singapore is one of the only places in the world to sequence all its Covid-19 cases and its data provides the most thorough glimpse yet of how the delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, spreads more rapidly. The strain has been identified in more than 60 countries over the past six months since its discovery in India, and concerns are growing that it may extend the pandemic in some places.

singapore,"Today, I was threatened by the state, on pain of monetary penalty or detention without trial, to turn up at a godforsaken place that I did not want to be at.

After showing up at this place, I was threatened by the state, on pain of monetary penalty or detention without trial, to cut my hair. I had been growing out my hair long because I liked the way it looked. What, you think I do this for *women*? But I had to cut it anyway. It wasn't worth the punishment.

After my hair had been cut (after obtaining my consent under circumstances that would amount to duress if a private citizen had made those threats to me), I was then (quite rudely) told to risk my physical safety by engaging in strenuous physical activity that I never wanted to do. I'm not very fit, so these things aren't easy for me.

Luckily, I've seen some improvement in this respect recently, because the state has required me, on pain of monetary penalty or detention without trial, to keep my body at a minimum level of physical fitness, or attend mandatory training sessions in lieu of meeting those standards. Faced with such incentives, I can now passably drag my body across the jungle at a reasonable speed. Fortunately, I haven't yet suffered a permanent injury from doing these things. I have friends who have slipped discs or blown-out knees that continue to hurt them till this day.

Obviously, today was not the most fun day I had ever had. I was looking forward to a good meal at home with my wife. But when I got home, she hadn't cooked dinner! I was slightly surprised.

""Why havent't you cooked dinner?""

""Hello, on what basis do you expect me to cook? I don't want to cook, and that should be enough for you? Who can make me do what I don't want to do?""

She had a point there.

So we went down to the hawker centre to buy dinner back. After a whole day of being pushed around, I admit that my eyes were drawn to a young woman with long, luscious locks. My wife had short hair, which wasn't really my personal preference. Feeling particularly brave, I asked her -

""Dear, maybe you could grow out your hair abit? Looks nicer lah, just my preference. For me?""

This did not end well for me, obviously.

""Eh hello, my hair right? I'm a 25 year old woman leh. I pay taxes and contribute to society you know. I cannot decide what kind of hair I want to keep is it?""

Fuck, she had me again. But it wasn't over:

""Today your mouth very big ah? Got anything else to comment on? Like my body? Am I fat anot? Want me lose weight?""

""Now that I mention it, I wouldn't mind -""

""Go to hell lah pig! My body my choice!""

I had no good counterargument. She was right after all. I decided to choose my dinner in silence from then on.

I wish that were the end of it. But then when we were walking home ah, *siao liao*, 5 fighter jets fly overhead, damn loud. My wife screamed. She's not really that concerned with regional strategic affairs, and immediately assumed that Singapore was under attack. I told her that there was nothing to worry about; National Day was coming up and those were just the pilots training for the parade flyby.

""Wah lucky ah. Anyway never mind right, if really kena invade, you will go and save me right? Actually, every guy on this street must go and save me! Hahaha!""

A couple of guys walking by glared at her as she said that. I guess she's describing the state of things quite accurately. I didn't really understand why she got annoyed looks, she was right after all.

Anyway, I booked in for first day of ICT today. What did you guys do?

Hey everyone,

Just a quick PSA! Not sure if this is common knowledge but there's this scam going around on whatsapp claiming that you can earn upwards of $500/day by becoming this ""online purchasing agent"". Personally i'm not *that* susceptible to these scams but i thought i'd find out more out of curiosity.

So from what i can gather, you gotta help these small e-commerce merchants gain exposure by first helping them purchase their items on Lazada, and the amount will be subsequently refunded back to you plus 10% commission. So obviously, this is a red flag la but i can see how it might be quite easy for others to be enticed.

I dug further and found [this reddit post](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/mh9s18/prevalent_scam_to_watch_out_for_lazada_affiliate/) from the msia subreddit warning about the same scam. AND INTERESTINGLY, the texts they use are pretty much identical, so it further solidifies the fact that it's a scam LOL. Y'all can check out the post the guy spilled out the whole scam operation/tactic in the comment section.

Also, i can't confirm this but if u look at the ""Online Purchasing Grp"" i was added in to, most of the people there have +60 mobile numbers from malaysia, and i'm pretty sure they're all in on the scam (or that they're bots). But gotta give them credit tho, they're good. They've been sending bank transfer screenshots and shit and tbh it looks really believable.

So yes, be careful everyone! Don't want anybody losing money like this T.T

singapore,"Let's face it. In a land scarce Singapore, putting money in Real Estate is a non-productive and inflationary way to make individual gains at the cost of societal welfare.  


However I also think it is an unfortunately necessary evil.  


We should clarify why it is non-productive first. There are two kinds of capital, productive and rent seeking.  


Productive Capital are the investments that lead to the development or acquisition of assets, technologies or skills that allow new or more efficient/profitable methods of production/marketing of goods or services. Whether these new methods or goods/services are beneficial or not is another argument, but ultimately they are additions and alterations to the whole of economic activity, and under the reasoned guidance of government, it will probably work out to everyone's benefit.   


Rent Seeking Capital are investments that seek to extract monies by purchasing control of a particular element of an existing method of production, which is often a indispensable part of economy, such as land or water rights. These investments do not add to the overall economic activity, but instead extract out a sum that inevitably gets passed on, adding inefficiency and higher costs to the overall economy.  


All investments are a mix of both, depending on the circumstances. However in Singapore, Real Estate investments, especially REITS, private property and overpriced HDBS intended to rent to foreigners/PRs, are explicitly Rent Seeking. Take an industrial building for example, as private property investments pour into surrounding area, the land price of building's owner increases and the owner must pass on the opportunity cost of not selling to their tenants in the form of higher rents, which to the extent that they are small businesses, will pass on that cost as higher prices in their products. If the owner does sell however, the new owner will probably also charge higher rents to recoup their investment. If the land appreciation + rent increases are only local, the tenants may choose to go elsewhere if possible, but if it is a Singapore wide phenomenon, then must either pass on the rent fees or move overseas. For some businesses it is possible, but for essential local services like F&amp;B it is impossible. Unsurprisingly F&amp;B outlets suffer the most outrageous rental arrangements.  


Real Estate Investment is also inflationary, in that it increases the price of goods without adding equal value. From a supply and demand POV, this effect is obvious. Singapore's real (or politically motivated) scarcity of land creates a near vertical supply curve, where higher prices don't increase price by much. Hence when demand increases, the price increases without much change in supply. However this goes a lot further than land prices alone, as most essential goods are linked to price. Housing Rents (or Mortgage payments) is the most obvious, and Dine in Food because of passed on Mall Rental Fees. Export manufacturing goods/services must also work in rental costs into their export price, as well as the housing costs of their workers as a part of salary costs. Many goods contain a passed on land-rental fees. Given that Singapore is an international facing economy, uncompetitive export prices (and comparatively competitive import prices) due to inflation is especially dangerous.  


The worst thing is that this inflationary non-competitiveness is entirely artificial and 'unnecessary' because most of it arises from demand driven inflation due to Singaporean investment money not wanting to go anywhere else.  


However I think that unless Index Funds, Crypto or other investment alternatives gain the appeal and safety of real estate, this situation of Singaporeans constantly pouring their excess cash into real estate investments is a situation that can't be helped.  


The problem is that many Singaporeans with money to invest aren't especially suited to earning money from productive capital.   


Singaporean PMETs, as overworked as they are, don't really have the bandwidth to start a business on the side. The wealthiest PMETs also work for governments and foreign MNCs/GLCs, the former of which doesn't exactly prepare one to jumpstart a SME, the latter of which utilising (due to their size) too complex of production methods to mimic on an SME scale with individual investment. This is also not considering the more technical positions where productive techniques are acquired are often filled by foreign talent due to our labor policy of prioritizing technical skill in foreign migrants.  


Our local SME capitalists aren't in that good of a situation either, as preferential tax policy towards foreign MNCs has priced alot of them out from major productive sectors, leaving only subsidiary/supplier roles and the odd niches where MNCs don't find profitable enough. The profit margins there are often not enough to be worth the investment, especially the opportunity cost investment of PMETs that are used to drawing Gov/GLC/MNC salaries.  


We lack the time, energy and technical competencies to delve head first into productive capital and get our ROIs from jumpstarting our own business and going through the pains of producing, marketing and selling our own product. A tiring and dangerous affair scarcely worth the possibly meager returns.

In light of this, ""passive"" forms of income investment are more preferable, as they allow safe, steady and predictable returns on investment to take place concurrently with full time employment in lucrative positions. The king of this is real estate, with more ""active"" property management being less preferable, and more ""passive"" forms like REITS being more preferable.  


This is because the inescapable fact is that people grow old and become less employable, and the wage and lifestyle commanded previously by PMETs undergoes severe risk upon retirement. In the absence of their own business or strong filial contributions by one's children, the risk of destitution exists for the retired middle class.  


Stocks and other investment assets do exist, however they are exposed at least symbolically to the risk of sudden crashes, always fresh in the memory of anyone whose family member was affected by an economic crisis.   


CPF also exists, however as a cash based account, it is also vulnerable to inflation that exceeds its interest earned. The same goes for all other cash based savings, or variations of it.  


So that leaves Real Estate as the only asset that is confirmed to always at least keep pace with inflation, whilst also providing regular passive and retirement proof income streams in the form of rents or REITS dividends.  


What is achieve is individual safety, the cost is societal detriment. The worst being borne on the next generation that must suffer directly from higher rents, choose to have less children as a result of the resultant smaller disposable income/less time away from working to pay rent.   


This shrinking population effect should mean a demand side fall on rents and real estate prices, but since that would endanger too many retirements, it is likely that a politically motivated supply restriction on land/buildings will be engaged to maintain prices. This leading overall to a shrinking and less vibrant economy.  


This is ironic because as an Asian Society, we used to invest heavily in our children as a means to secure our retirement, financing them to have more children to broaden the base and better secure the silver years of the most elder. This is a form of productive capital investment. However as filial piety declines as a reliable route for retirement (for many reasons), the resultant retirement funds capital flight into rent seeking real estates achieves the opposite effect, increasing rents/housing prices and making it more difficult to have children.  


So it seems the solution is to have children and finance those children to have more children, but really how many of us can safely count on our children being their for our later years? How many families remain with the moral and emotional core that can sustain this kind of arrangement?","Real Estate is a Non-Productive Asset, but it is necessary for Retirement in Singaporean Society","Let's face it. In a land scarce Singapore, putting money in Real Estate is a non-productive and inflationary way to make individual gains at the cost of societal welfare.  


However I also think it is an unfortunately necessary evil.  


We should clarify why it is non-productive first. There are two kinds of capital, productive and rent seeking.  


Productive Capital are the investments that lead to the development or acquisition of assets, technologies or skills that allow new or more efficient/profitable methods of production/marketing of goods or services. Whether these new methods or goods/services are beneficial or not is another argument, but ultimately they are additions and alterations to the whole of economic activity, and under the reasoned guidance of government, it will probably work out to everyone's benefit.   


Rent Seeking Capital are investments that seek to extract monies by purchasing control of a particular element of an existing method of production, which is often a indispensable part of economy, such as land or water rights.

1) Location Based recommendation systems for hawkers around you 
2) Online space where hawker stories are featured through visual storytelling
3) Centralizing different efforts across Singapore on a unified project for Hawkers

We realised that a steep learning curve meant that many hawkers, especially the less tech savvy ones will be left behind in this digital era. Additionally, digitalization can be an arduous process with little to no incremental value to the hawkers themselves. During our rounds, it was further revealed that forcing hawkers to personally sign up for digital payment and delivery services may not be a feasible solution and remains to be a business problem, both operationally and financially. While we cannot eradicate these worrying phenomenon, we can increase the exposure of hawkers through digital means at no charge.

Currently, we are building our database by personally walking the grounds and chatting with our friendly neighbourhood hawkers. This is apart from the wonderful recommendations from Facebook groups, as well as the kind souls who have shared their database with us (Thank you OldieGoodieHawker).

As a Swedish software engineer this baffles me.

In Sweden unpaid overtime would normally be part of contract specification and has higher starting salary.

If there is no contract obligations you will mostly be able to refuse overtime, or get a big bonus for doing it.

I think that she is scared or embarrassed to say no, but I don't have the cultural context to judge if she is too timid in this case.

She has been complaining a lot about her boss forcing her to do unpaid overtime. The work has been seemingly not critical. I think it is somewhat hard for the company to replace her.

As a Swedish software engineer this baffles me.

In Sweden unpaid overtime would normally be part of contract specification and has higher starting salary.

If there is no contract obligations you will mostly be able to refuse overtime, or get a big bonus for doing it.

I think that she is scared or embarrassed to say no, but I don't have the cultural context to judge if she is too timid in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:

1. Is this type of overtime work normal?
2. Can you reasonably refuse?
3. How to handle it?

Thanks for any feedback! Work/life balance as a software engineer"

TLDR? Title says all. But this is not to be confused with country codes. Maybe this is the wrong place to ask/discuss this. But where though, hardwarezone? I do know 653 may have been reported as scam numbers too. But that's the same for any numbers that has been spoofed no?

**As a rule of thumb**

Usually, or at least it has been promoted, that you should ignore any + numbers (And sure, you could say ""ignore any numbers that is not within your contacts"" which yeah that's a good measure too. Or ""waiting to see if they would call you again"" (which is also a good measure but idk? A scammer could call you twice))

My mobile phone is set (unless my memory fails me that you can't set this on a phone anymore) to always show +65 in front of Singapore numbers as long as that number is not in my contacts (which occasionally it does, occasionally it doesn't).

Level '6' numbers are reserved for both PSTN and IPT, so you can't say telecommunication networks in Singapore don't route IPT numbers on a PSTN.

Most people and organization's numbers begin with 6, 8 or 9. I have never actually seen a Singapore phone number that starts with 3 being advertised. (Or maybe I'm not paying enough attention. Or does the lack of advertisement suggest that it's not meant to be used by everyone?)

singapore,"The past few weeks i have been feeling quite down, lonely and have nobody to talk to.

I don't necessarily think that this is a result of covid-19, maybe partially. Perhaps change of interest?

See, when i was young, i was really into gaming. games like maplestory, to blackshot and transition to league of legends. But i have quitted LoL for years already as i feel like i am not enjoying the game anymore and it is too time consuming.

However, after that i have since ''lost purpose in life'', or maybe a better word is that i don't have something to fill in the void of time and also... i don't have much friends? i lost contact with alot of my gaming friends

1) i used to have alot of really close buddies like those we shit talk each others, but as years past, we gradually lose contact, alot of those are friends i made in maplestory. but then i was only like maybe 14 or 15 years old so i am pretty shy, i didnt really meet up with any of them but simply through text messages. i realised that some people who used to game in their 20s at that point of time meet up annd some of them became really close. 

i don't think that i am that into gaming but rather, the social aspect of gaming? And also most importantly, do you guys feel that games nowadays no longer have the social aspect in it? As in most of them was simply we play against them and then its gone. I find that it is quite challenging to make friends online nowadays. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, its not to say that i have no friends, i have several that i chat with them frequently, but none are really that close, like those that we used to trash talk each other when young. i find that the ''quality of friends'' decline signinficantly?

&amp;#x200B;

2) this is weird but what do you guys do during your free time? i find that i am aimlessly scrolling around facebook and instagram but theres only so much news or story to view, in a way thats my only past time...

&amp;#x200B;

3) i used to be quite shy in the past since my focus was really on making my in game character better. 

i honestly felt quite lonely nowadays, i enjoyed chatting with alot of my nsf friends in camp, i think i am going to ask them out for some gathering next time when covid-19 reopens again. What do ''friends'' usually do outside? go out for lunch/dinner and then back to home? (idk sorry this sounds a little bit stupid), how do i spend more time with my friends?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway i make this post in like 10min with thoughts i had for many many months, i just feel quite lonely, sad and in a way, i don't know what to do with my life. I used to be very happy during school holiday but now i have no idea what to do with my life tho..

My internship ended in December 2020 and until now we've still haven't gotten our pay. The school hasn't been much help. Their legal team has been looking into this matter but even till now, there weren't many updates. We've been told by the school that because the contract was between us and the company, the school is unable to help much. They suggested for us to send a letter of demand to the company, but the problem with that is the company has no office and we're told that sending it to our boss' residence address would be considered as harassment.

singapore,"Yep, it's a few days in, but its never too late to wish aall y'all here in Singapore a Happy Pride Month!! 

Pride month is normally held in June to commemorate the Stonewall Riots in June 1969, when a police raid of the Stonewall Inn gay bar lead to a massive movement for LGBT+ rights initially in the United States, but now celebrated pretty much worldwide, including in Singapore, with PinkDot 13 year going, and multiple community events lined up as well.

The meaning of Pride Month is thus kinda two-fold. It's meant to commemorate the historical &amp; embedded exclusion of LGBT+ people in society just for being who they are, thus it's meant to fight against systems that are not inclusive to LGBT+ people. This is most definitely not forgotten in Singapore, where earlier this year we've had court challenges against section 377A (our anti-homosexuality law) being dismissed, and uncovered systematic discrimination of trans students in our educational institutions

However, it is also a form of **celebration** for the LGBT+ community. To express self-love, self-care and gratitude for being who you are, regardless of sexuality or gender. In a world where people beat you up, metaphorically, emotionally and sometimes literally, for being LGBT+, this is the time to find communities that acknowledge, care, love and understand who you are, and will celebrate with you.

This month, there are plenty of such events. PinkDot is, once again, going to be hosted **online**, at 12th June, 8 p.m.. The livestream will be held [on their website](https://pinkdot.sg/). Additionally, there will be a virtual light-up of the island of Singapore, and anybody, be it queer or a straight ally, can help light up the island at loveliveshere.pinkdot.sg!!

Additionally, for other queer events, deals and movements that aren't PinkDot related, [**PinkFest.sg**](https://pinkfest.sg/) has quite the list of such events, so check them out while you can! Post links to other queer-friendly events and spaces too if you wish :--)

I thought it was bad enough but it just got worse as I read on, and the audio link is in the bio also, listening to it really made me feel bad for the victims too.

singapore,"After seeing so many hate comments and posts here, I think it's time for a look at cycling in Singapore both from an objective and subjective standpoint. I have been and am all types of ""cyclist"", the casual commuter, the delivery boy and the weekend warrior. My post here is obviously going to be biased towards cycling, so keep that in mind while you're reading the subjective portion. Now let's look at cycling in SG.     
      
**The Facts**      
As of 2017, [1 to 2%](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-why-singapore-has-yet-to-become-a-cycling-paradise-11171774#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20figure%20is%20about,and%20shower%20facilities%20at%20workplaces.)of sgeans cycle as a form of commute. For comparison, it is 1% for USA, 5% for Switzerland, 4% for Norway, 8% for Belgium, 24% for Denmark and 25% for Netherlands. For countries/territories more... similar (thats subjective) to SG, we have Taiwan at 5.1% and Hong Kong at 0.5%. Make what you will with those figures.     
     
Cycling on footpaths is allowed in SG, but only at 10km/h.      
Cycling on Park Connector Networks (PCNs), which includes both dedicated bike lanes and shared paths (for both pedestrians and cyclists), is at 25km/h.     
The average speed of a jogger completing 2.4km in 12mins (you can't even get gold if you're 21) is 12km/h. Something for you to think about.     
Cycling on roads is allowed, contrary to some nutters here who compare cycling on roads to a helicopter landing on an road (which is obviously against the law). 
If you want to ride on the road however, you must follow road rules (obviously) wear a helmet, etc.  
Cycling on expressways and certain tunnels and viaducts however, is strictly forbidden. The full list is [here](https://onemotoring.lta.gov.sg/content/onemotoring/home/driving/road_safety_and_vehicle_rules/driving-in-expressway-and-tunnel.html#when_driving_in_expressways&amp;tunnels). Cyclists are allowed on highways (such as Nicoll highway and West Coast highway), but how safe that is up to you to figure out.     
On a road with 2 or more lanes in each direction, cyclists are allowed to ride abreast in the leftmost lane, or straight up occupy the lane, though these behaviors are strongly discouraged, unless there are safety concerns.
     
**The Reality**       
**Commuting**     
Now that I've bombed you with some relevant facts, here's what a ""cyclist"" like me faces when I commute (say to buy dinner, shop for groceries). Firstly, the PCN near my home is a shared path. It is also highly used, both by pedestrians and cyclists. This PCN is already very gracious, easily accommodating 3 bikes cycling abreast (about 4m across), and yet on peak hours, I am unable to cycle without stopping. Why? Literally the same reason drivers rage at cyclists. Families walking in neat rows across the PCN that would make my sergeant weep tears of joy. Students walking in a similar manner blasting music, oblivious to my bell. Is this behavior wrong? No! Of course not! What it simply does it make cycling difficult. I have learned to just avoid peak hours and get my dinner earlier. If I do get stuck, Ill say ""on your right"" and hope they hear me. Occasionally, I'll get irritated looks. Once I'm out of the PCN that suddenly ends, I have to ride on the pavement, since I don't wear a helmet to get dinner. Contrary to what people believe here, bicycles cannot fly nor teleport, so when a PCN ends, we have to cycle on the pavement. The pavements in my districts are hilariously narrow, especially (WHY??) in front of a primary and secondary school. I usually push my bike with my left leg if I'm lazy or dismount if it's too crowded. The worst however are the delivery ppl on PMDs and bikes that rush past. The bicycle parking at my local shopping mall is pretty standard fare and honestly, I like that. I must say I live in the east, where imo, the districts are more bike friendly. I don't really know much about the west.      
     
**Weekend cycling**      
I love cycling at ECP, but strangely enough, there isn't a PCN leading from my house straight to ECP!!!! Whaddyaknow!!! Therefore, I have to cycle on the road to get to the PCN that leads to ECP. Capice? If I could, I wouldn't cycle on the road to ECP because Bedok Road is a single lane road and I don't want to hold up the buses and cars. How about the pavement? Why not ride on the pavement? Here, I can't speak for all pavements and all roads, but the pavements at Bedok Road are undulating in height, do not have smooth transitions (from road back to pavement), swerve at 90 angles to go around trees, have interesting ""speed bumps"", are interestingly narrow at points and of course have pedestrians. I actually tried riding on the pavement from my house to ECP and that very act took longer than cycling from the start of ECP to Marina Bay, despite the 25km/h speed limit on PCNs. Oh, did I mention I got a tire punctured? That's not even accounting the danger of falling or hitting a pedestrian. Next, cycling at ECP during weekends is honestly getting worse due to covid. The amount of people there is frankly amazing. The shared paths are so full of pedestrians it's almost impossible to cycle at certain points. Even on bike lanes, you have plenty of joggers, skaters and pedestrians, making it hard to cycle as well. If you guys are interested enough, Im cycling at ECP tomorrow and I'll take a video/pictures if enough of yall want.
Next, on days where I'm feeling like I could take on the Tour de France, I go to Tanah Merah Coastal Road, literally the only place in Singapore where there's a dedicated bike lane which you can cycle over 25km/h. Moreover, traffic lights here are more spaced apart, so you can go for longer without stopping. Thank you LTA. Legit, no sarcasm. But also sucks to be you, westies. However here, we have to contend with pieces of wood and stones, blown sand off of trucks causing your tires to lose traction and the occasional trailer passing 2meters away from you at 80km/h. Did I also mention the bike path is wide enough only for 2 cyclists to cycle abreast? Anyone overtaking must go onto the road beside the bike lane. Add to the fact that this is the only dedicated bike lane in SG for roadies (read: more than 25kmh), you can see the problem. Overcrowding. This is because fundamentally, TMCR is a painted bike gutter lane. It's not a true, separated bicycle path. I'm not complaining. It's better than nothing. But this is the truth.
     
**Fked up cyclists and delivery riders**      
Yes, I'm lumping my experience with delivery with all the pieces of shit I've seen while cycling. Though I'd like to believe I'm more considerate than what I've witnessed, onlookers would probably not agree. I've seen my fair share of cyclists of all sorts beat the red light, cut lanes without care and cycle like they own the lane. Delivery people cycling way too fast near crowded areas. Spamming the bell as if everyone else's time doesn't matter. I'm not defending any actions against the law. I'm not defending these ""legal"" actions that are nonetheless extremely dangerous and irritating. If it were up to me, I would use footage from whatever cameras available and make examples of these people. Come on fine proportionately. Those lycra roadies on their 15k Pinarellos and Cervelos probably won't care about a 1k fine. If they cycle on an expressway or run a red light, confiscate their bikes. If delivery riders ride in an unsafe manner, work with grab/foodpanda whatever and suspend their license for a week. If just one of these pricks make it on the news, it would give many others pause before thinking of doing the same stupid thing.
      
**What is this post supposed to do?**       
I want you guys, even if it's just a little, to be able to empathize with those who cycle.     
If we cycle on pavement - we cause danger to the old, the young and the frail.      
If we ride on roads - we are a road hog, a nuisance and take up ppl's time.      
If we cycle on whatever PCNs are available - we still have to share with pedestrians most of the time, and some aren't in great condition.        
       
Please, spare a though for us. Asking for better infrastructure isn't unreasonable. Drivers literally have a road to go everywhere you need to go. We definitely do not. If I had the money, I would buy a car and fk cycling, but alas beggars can't be choosers. For cyclists out there, please, don't give non-cyclists any more reasons to hate us. Obey the rules. Even if there are no cars at the junction, don't beat the red light. If you have to miraculously transform from a road user to a pedestrian or vice versa, do it at a safe, less traffic area. If you can't cycle faster than the bus, don't overtake the bus at the busstop and hold up the bus for the rest of the road. There are 40++ ppl on the bus. There is 1 of you. People hate us. Let's try to be as likeable as possible.     
     
While waiting for the government to build better infrastructure and pass better policies, I like what one of the redditors here had to say. Infrastructure takes years to build. There're some places where it may never be feasible to build cycling infrastructure as well. But what we can do is change our mentality. Let's be more understanding to each other. At the end of the day, there aren't ""cyclists"" or ""drivers"" or ""pedestrians"", merely people. And some people will always be idiots. For those cyclists and drivers who insist on being pricks, show them that actions must have consequences.","Hating on cycling, POV from a cyclist","After seeing so many hate comments and posts here, I think it's time for a look at cycling in Singapore both from an objective and subjective standpoint.

What can I do to get my documents? Where can I report such unfair labour practises?

* He still cannot issue me my paycheck because, again, he pins the blame on me because they cannot contact me. He sent me no email, text, nor call. So it is my fault he can't pay me.

As much as I want to punch him in the face, I always remained calm and never talk back. Because people like him has a huge ego and talking back would do more harm than good.  Even as I resigned, he wished me good luck.

I found a more decent company that treats its employees like humans. But the former boss seems to be jealous or something. He didn't reply to my request for my work documents.

What can I do to get my documents? Where can I report such unfair labour practises?

Tldr: the former boss is selfish, didn't pay me, won't release my documents.

UPDATE:

* Call finally went through my former evil boss. Passively aggressively pins the blame on me. Told me he tried calling and emailing me. But there is no record of this. He lied.
* He still cannot issue me my paycheck because, again, he pins the blame on me because they cannot contact me. He sent me no email, text, nor call. So it is my fault he can't pay me.
* Current company understood the situation and waived the required documents.

Edited:

* Already reported it to MOM.
* However, can't show them proof since my previous employer destroyed all evidence.
* Employer has control of the chat, emails, and co-working software. All of our previous conversations, transactions and my resignation are all deleted.
* I am a foreign worker. I work for the company remotely.
* This company has an office in my country, but I work with the SG team.
* [Here is part of the contract where it says I cannot say anything BS about said company.](https://imgur.com/a/dYrZbqA)
* Edited out some details to prevent them from recognising me. My former boss is overworking their employees. I formally resigned and found a new job but they won't give me my required documents nor did he give my last payment."

Hey everyone,

**Backstory if you missed the original post**

* Many digitally challenged hawkers (elderly, illiterate, etc) who are unable to leverage on food delivery are suffering greatly now and are on the brink of closing down. If they're unable to tide over this period they will be taking years of rich hawker heritage with them. I'm sure we've seen the numerous news articles (e.g [https://www.todayonline.com/8days/eatanddrink/newsandopening/illiterate-elderly-hawkers-who-cant-offer-delivery-forced-consider](https://www.todayonline.com/8days/eatanddrink/newsandopening/illiterate-elderly-hawkers-who-cant-offer-delivery-forced-consider))
* The most straightforward way is to support them directly by purchasing from them if I was in the vicinity.
* However, I realized I didn't know who or where they were. If only there was something which allows me to know of these stalls at a glance. It would be very useful for everyone and drive traffic to these stalls, why doesn't it exist?
* Hence, this map being born to provide a **convenient** and **accessible** way to address that information asymmetry, and make it easier for us to find and support them!

**Developments since Launch**

* This started with only 10 stalls that I had compiled from online sources, but kind people stepped up to help (Big shoutout to u/yellowbean9 and OldieGoodieHawker!)
* Contributions slowly trickled in, and we were compiling manually from different social media posts as well, we now have **200 stalls** and the newer data points come with the **backstories** as well (see picture 2)!

singapore,"Hi everyone I noticed there aren't many fixed gear posts on here so I thought of chiming in as a local fixed gear cyclist myself. I don't intend to push any agenda I just want to be informative.

# What is fixed gear ?
I don't think there's an official definition, but I believe when people talk about fixie or fixed gear bikes, they are referring to the same thing. A fixed gear bike has only one gear, and that single cog (attached to the rear wheel) is 'fixed' to the motion of the cranks. This means that, like conventional bikes you see on the road, when you pedal forwards, the bike goes forward. But for fixed gear, if you pedal backwards, the wheel goes backwards as well. It's easier to demonstrate this in a video/ in person.

# Fixie no brakes ?
Again, I don't think there's an official standard as to whether fixed gear bikes have brakes or not, but from the many fixed gear cyclists I've seen in the community, there are riders with brakes, and riders without. It's entirely up to the rider. Most fixed gear bikes have the front hole drilled in the fork to fit a conventional rim brake. The reason why many fixed gear cyclists don't use brakes is because the fixed gear system is inherently a braking system as well. Since the wheels are fixed to the motion of the cranks, you can pedal backwards and counter the forward motion of the bike. You can resist the forward motion gradually but it's quite inefficient. Instead, with proper technique, you can completely stop the rear wheel from moving even while the bike is still in motion. This is known as skidding. This is the most popular way of braking. When I first started riding fixed, I couldn't skid. I used a front brake. I practised skidding while still having a front brake. It took me some time to confidently stop by skidding. Skidding isn't my most efficient method actually lol I do a 'jump skid' that looks like I'm hopping on my bike. Again, it's hard to describe this through text.

And now the hot question hahaha can skidding replace brakes ? Personally I would say it depends hahahahhaha. I feel there are two main conditions to be able to go brakeless. First you'll need to be experienced and confident in your skidding ability. Second, your legs and lungs need to be conditioned to it. Nobody seems to bring my second point up. SKIDDING IS EXHAUSTING. Especially if you're cycling far and fast. Maybe I'm just weak or my gear ratio is too high lol. To stop a fixed gear bike, you need to counter your forward motion. So if you're cycling fast, there's more motion to counter. Imagine doing this between traffic lights. It's tiring.

## Since skidding is not easy, why go brakeless at all ?
Hahaha this is the one thing I can't shine a good light on the community. [Brakeless just looks much better.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/109906786@N06/) I think the worst combo, aesthetically, is riser bars + brakes + black aluminium rims with faded brake track. It makes the bike look cheap. I think the best way to look good with brakes is drop bars + cross top lever + carbon rims. This topic is extremely subjective lol. 

# Where did fixed gear come from ?
I believe wayyy back all bikes were fixed gear until multiple gears and freewheel hubs were introduced. Fixed gear is still used in indoor track events like in the olympics, velodrome races, Japanese keirin races. Track bikes don't have brakes. I guess cuz lighter faster and no traffic lights. Speaking of track bikes, I think I should clarify that track bikes are a subset of fixed gear bikes. Most fixed gear bikes you see aren't built like track bikes - to be super aero and all. They're built up to be a little more tough. Street builds.  

But in this post I want to focus on the local scene so where do fixed gear bikes come from ??? Where do you buy one ?? I'm not too familiar what happened 'at the start' but currently there's this brand from China called Tsunami that makes very cheap fixed gear frames. Search up fixed gear on aliexpress or taobao and you'll see that there's $200 Tsunami frames with $150 wheels, and $50 OTA cranks. Carousell it and you can find a full bike for $200 or so. There's also this brand intro7 that's been dishing out lots of affordable fixed gear stuff. These tsunami fixes are very popular within the local fixed gear community because the community is mostly secondary school kids without a lot of money hahahha. Of course there's higher end brands ranging from Engine 11, Cinelli, Look etc.. I believe most fixed gear cyclists order them through local bike shops that specialise in fixed gear bikes namely, cycleprojectstore, progressionbikes, and fishtail cyclery.

# Who are fixed gear cyclists ?
Rowdy noisy secondary school kids riding tsunami fixies appear to be the face of the community because they have been making headlines and they're always blasting JBL at PCNs but that's not everyone. A couple of years ago before I even started riding fixed, there was as local fixed gear race called Holy Crit. There was also this popular mass ride event called Mega Mass Ride. I believe these two events plus bike messengers took the spotlight until Holy Crit stopped. This wasn't my era so I don't know much. But now from what I see, the local fixed gear community isn't one big united group. It's just small groups of friends here and there. Fixed gear communities overseas seem to be more united and organised.

# Why fixed gear ?
It's just really fun. I feel that fixed gear is like an enthusiast level of cycling. It's quite like mechanical keyboards hahhaha. People will always say simplicity, maintenance whatever but personally I think it's just fun. Some might say it's idiotic to ride a bike that's harder to ride since no gears but like I said, you need to try it to understand. The power trasmission, the control, the feel (lol im like describing mechanical kb too). You probably won't understand it until you've spent time riding a convential road bike and then switch to fixed.

Sorry for my incoherent writing there's just so much I would love to write about. My opinions may even be misinformed so lmk if I missed anything. I'm actually quite opinionated about bikes so I hope I remained objective lol.",Some FAQ of the local fixed gear scene,"Hi everyone I noticed there aren't many fixed gear posts on here so I thought of chiming in as a local fixed gear cyclist myself. I don't intend to push any agenda I just want to be informative.

# What is fixed gear ?
I don't think there's an official definition, but I believe when people talk about fixie or fixed gear bikes, they are referring to the same thing. A fixed gear bike has only one gear, and that single cog (attached to the rear wheel) is 'fixed' to the motion of the cranks. This means that, like conventional bikes you see on the road, when you pedal forwards, the bike goes forward. But for fixed gear, if you pedal backwards, the wheel goes backwards as well. It's easier to demonstrate this in a video/ in person.

# Fixie no brakes ?
Again, I don't think there's an official standard as to whether fixed gear bikes have brakes or not, but from the many fixed gear cyclists I've seen in the community, there are riders with brakes, and riders without. It's entirely up to the rider. Most fixed gear bikes have the front hole drilled in the fork to fit a conventional rim brake. The reason why many fixed gear cyclists don't use brakes is because the fixed gear system is inherently a braking system as well. Since the wheels are fixed to the motion of the cranks, you can pedal backwards and counter the forward motion of the bike. You can resist the forward motion gradually but it's quite inefficient. Instead, with proper technique, you can completely stop the rear wheel from moving even while the bike is still in motion. This is known as skidding. This is the most popular way of braking. When I first started riding fixed, I couldn't skid. I used a front brake. I practised skidding while still having a front brake. It took me some time to confidently stop by skidding. Skidding isn't my most efficient method actually lol I do a 'jump skid' that looks like I'm hopping on my bike. Again, it's hard to describe this through text.

And now the hot question hahaha can skidding replace brakes ? Personally I would say it depends hahahahhaha. I feel there are two main conditions to be able to go brakeless. First you'll need to be experienced and confident in your skidding ability. Second, your legs and lungs need to be conditioned to it. Nobody seems to bring my second point up. SKIDDING IS EXHAUSTING. Especially if you're cycling far and fast. Maybe I'm just weak or my gear ratio is too high lol. To stop a fixed gear bike, you need to counter your forward motion. So if you're cycling fast, there's more motion to counter. Imagine doing this between traffic lights. It's tiring.

## Since skidding is not easy, why go brakeless at all ?
Hahaha this is the one thing I can't shine a good light on the community. [Brakeless just looks much better.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/109906786@N06/) I think the worst combo, aesthetically, is riser bars + brakes + black aluminium rims with faded brake track. It makes the bike look cheap. I think the best way to look good with brakes is drop bars + cross top lever + carbon rims. This topic is extremely subjective lol. 

# Where did fixed gear come from ?
I believe wayyy back all bikes were fixed gear until multiple gears and freewheel hubs were introduced. Fixed gear is still used in indoor track events like in the olympics, velodrome races, Japanese keirin races. Track bikes don't have brakes. I guess cuz lighter faster and no traffic lights. Speaking of track bikes, I think I should clarify that track bikes are a subset of fixed gear bikes. Most fixed gear bikes you see aren't built like track bikes - to be super aero and all. They're built up to be a little more tough. Street builds.  

But in this post I want to focus on the local scene so where do fixed gear bikes come from ??? Where do you buy one ?? I'm not too familiar what happened 'at the start' but currently there's this brand from China called Tsunami that makes very cheap fixed gear frames. Search up fixed gear on aliexpress or taobao and you'll see that there's $200 Tsunami frames with $150 wheels, and $50 OTA cranks. Carousell it and you can find a full bike for $200 or so. There's also this brand intro7 that's been dishing out lots of affordable fixed gear stuff. These tsunami fixes are very popular within the local fixed gear community because the community is mostly secondary school kids without a lot of money hahahha. Of course there's higher end brands ranging from Engine 11, Cinelli, Look etc.. I believe most fixed gear cyclists order them through local bike shops that specialise in fixed gear bikes namely, cycleprojectstore, progressionbikes, and fishtail cyclery.

# Who are fixed gear cyclists ?
Rowdy noisy secondary school kids riding tsunami fixies appear to be the face of the community because they have been making headlines and they're always blasting JBL at PCNs but that's not everyone. A couple of years ago before I even started riding fixed, there was as local fixed gear race called Holy Crit. There was also this popular mass ride event called Mega Mass Ride. I believe these two events plus bike messengers took the spotlight until Holy Crit stopped. This wasn't my era so I don't know much. But now from what I see, the local fixed gear community isn't one big united group. It's just small groups of friends here and there. Fixed gear communities overseas seem to be more united and organised.

**Ok so here goes:**  
Lately, there have been a few incidents that highlight the racism that exists in our society. I saw posts and videos of people of minority races responding to these incidents, and speaking up about the racism they have encountered in their lives. It broke my heart. I want to do better.

I want to do better, because racism (whether overt or casual) hurts people. It hurts the people the comments are directed at, and indirectly hurts the people in our society because it creates a culture that says that ""hey, racism is ok, bullying is ok"". When it is not.

What really stood out to me was this model/celebrity's(?) video calling us out on how we're pretending that racism is a recent phenomena. She explains that people of the minority races tend to have memories of racist encounters that go all the way back in their childhood. Man, how is this ok? How is it ok that we're so mean to kids, and teaching them from a young age that they're lesser than others? How is it ok that we're giving them trauma that they carry with them, and that they have to work extra hard to come to terms with and get rid of? 

You know all the nasty comments that we make. Harmful comments like ""eh later APNN come and catch you"". We may think it's just a casual comment, but that's super hurtful. That's like people saying ""eh be careful ah, later a Chinese catch you and fk up your sense of self-worth with racism"". At least there is some truth in the second statement given our behavior recently caught on tape. So can we please stop doing this? Can we treat everyone with acceptance and respect? 

We also have to stop tying wrongdoings to people's races. If someone is an a$$hole, then only HE/SHE is the a$$hole. Not his/her entire race. Because I don't see this happen with good things. So let's stop overgeneralizing just because it's convenient to do so. It is just not meaningful to make such conclusions about people based on their skin color. 

Also, I used to be one of those people who didn't believe in Chinese privilege in Singapore. I thought, ""How can I be privileged? I still have a bunch of problems."" But I decided to educate myself on the subject and boy, did it open my eyes. For the people who still don't believe in Chinese privilege, I strongly recommend this article from Harvard Business School: [https://hbr.org/2018/09/use-your-everyday-privilege-to-help-others](https://hbr.org/2018/09/use-your-everyday-privilege-to-help-others)

Hi all,

I was wondering how do we lodge a complaint against Starhub for failing to deliver a headset scheduled almost a week ago. I ordered a S21 from their online store a few weeks ago and recontracted my plan to buy it, paid fully on that day. 

They have been responsive in the customer call and facebook messenger (where they only replied after I complained in their posts) but all the agents just read from a copy pasted script saying ""We are sorry for your inconvenience and have expedited your case to the relevant team to call you back etc."" I had enough of that bs, I can also code a bot to type that response to customers. The sales team did try to contact me but called me at a random time (8pm) with just a few rings and stopped. There was no callback option.

What a great business model it is to sell something and collect the money with no delivery date given to customers. Am I now supposed to wait another month? A year?",STARHUB SCAM? Failure to deliver headset and no updates!,"

singapore,"There is always someone that sends complaint emails to the school to complain about their students' misbehaviour in public. Let me start off by saying that I'm in no way affected by this and I'm just genuinely curious why people do that and I need some closure, it's solely for the sake of knowledge.

It seems as if it is so that the students can change for the better, and I think that reason is only on the surface and it's what the complainant tell themselves too. Now, I might be very wrong, but I think the true reason a person would remember some bunch of teenagers' misbehaviour in public, keep it on their mind until they get home, take their time to search up the school's website and email to write an entire letter about what the students did and how they felt about it, is because of their unhappiness with life, my impression of them is that they are bitter, joy-hating adults. Keep in mind I'm not talking about MAJOR misbehaviours, I'm talking about students speaking a bit too loudly in public, students blocking/jamming passageways on bus etc.

Which kind of adult gets so bothered by a bunch of teenagers but also chooses to keep a mental note to write a complaint letter when they get home, instead of just telling the teens on the spot to correct their behaviour? I find it hard to believe they are complaining out of a sense of justice or just for the sake of correcting students' future behaviour. It's almost as if they are a little unsatisfied by the fact that when people who are wearing casual clothing speak too loudly on the bus for example, they cannot really file a complaint to anyone, so when one wears a uniform they go 'aha! I finally got you.'

When the students are wearing uniforms and misbehaving they see it as a chance to assert their authority and by sending a letter to the school they feel heard, and therefore significant, it is one of the very few moments where they can feel a sense of significance as people actually listen to them. I imagine it isn't nice to be an adult, coworkers making you suffer and you can't do anything about it, boss is being an absolute prick and you cannot complain nor do anything to teach him a lesson, society just stepping on you and you can't change anything or complain to anyone for help because nobody cares, so you're just suppressing everything while being a grumpy person that is bitter and angry with life, naturally, complaining to a school serves as an outlet to give them a true sense of significance which they can rarely find, it's the only time they feel heard and that someone actually listens to them.

I don't think they even care about whether the students change for the better, I mean, it isn't their kid anyway. They are sending complaint emails to feel important as they are making an entire school take action (make a speech about the complaint emails during students' mass assembly). Furthermore, why do they complain to schools? Schools have always taught us to be polite and disciplined students in public, if we were to behave otherwise, surely it isn't because of school? They're just releasing their unhappiness with life and complaining about those students serves as a way for them to do that. I just can't imagine a mature adult who's happy with life writing an entire complaint letter because they saw some bunch of teens talking too loudly on bus.

I don't know, I may be wrong, it's just been on my mind for a while, and I wanna seek some closure. Of course, I'm in no way saying that all adults who write complaint letters to school are bitter grumpy old men, I'm saying that majority of them might just be doing it out of frustration rather than genuinely wanting the students to change for the better. If you've written one of those complaint letters I'd be happy to hear why you wrote it or what you think, I would love to hear others' thoughts too, it's ok to be brutally honest, I just want to have more understanding.","People who write complaint emails to schools, what's the purpose?","There is always someone that sends complaint emails to the school to complain about their students' misbehaviour in public. Let me start off by saying that I'm in no way affected by this and I'm just genuinely curious why people do that and I need some closure, it's solely for the sake of knowledge.

It seems as if it is so that the students can change for the better, and I think that reason is only on the surface and it's what the complainant tell themselves too. Now, I might be very wrong, but I think the true reason a person would remember some bunch of teenagers' misbehaviour in public, keep it on their mind until they get home, take their time to search up the school's website and email to write an entire letter about what the students did and how they felt about it, is because of their unhappiness with life, my impression of them is that they are bitter, joy-hating adults. Keep in mind I'm not talking about MAJOR misbehaviours, I'm talking about students speaking a bit too loudly in public, students blocking/jamming passageways on bus etc.

Which kind of adult gets so bothered by a bunch of teenagers but also chooses to keep a mental note to write a complaint letter when they get home, instead of just telling the teens on the spot to correct their behaviour? I find it hard to believe they are complaining out of a sense of justice or just for the sake of correcting students' future behaviour. It's almost as if they are a little unsatisfied by the fact that when people who are wearing casual clothing speak too loudly on the bus for example, they cannot really file a complaint to anyone, so when one wears a uniform they go 'aha! I finally got you.'

I was at Suntec Convention Centre with my kids and I had to bring one of them to the bathroom. Seeing that the handicap toilet was equipped with a toddler seat, I brought my toddler in. 

As we were in the toilet, someone knocked vigorously on the door. Worried that it might be a handicapped person, I politely told them to hold on. As we were washing hands, there was another, more vigorous knocking. Apologising, I told them that I would out in a minute. 

As we rushed out of the toilet, to my surprise, there was no one. Just at that moment, a lady from an adjacent store exited from the store (she snuck under some barricade) and looked at me as she entered the handicap stall. At the same moment, another man rushed past us towards the direction of the handicap stall. 

It took a moment to register that they were heading into the same stall and someone had propped up a ‘cleaning in progress’ sign just outside the handicap stall.

Absolutely shocking that there can such a huge pride difference, sucked out of his thumb!  Do yourself a favor and don’t just go with first quote, ask around before getting any dental treatment. Can confirm that I had the dental treatment and am very happy with the result. PSA: Shop around for dental treatment before agreeing to anything!"
singapore,"So I've been using Singtel's prepaid card, Hi Card, since July 2018. Always used the entertainment data plan. Never gave me much data, but I was happy with it because it included free Spotify data, which is basically all I needed. Come about 1 year ago, my data started getting depleted extremely fast for no apparent reason. Took me a couple of months to get to the bottom of it, but I finally realised that it was because I started listening to podcasts (shout out to GlassWire, highly recommend it!). To my disappointment, podcasts are not included in the Spotify data. I don't even know how Singtel distinguishes it, or why they do it, but the fact is, they do. Fair enough, I just need to download my podcasts in advance, and if I forget to do it, I can always listen to my favourite artists instead. And then... Singtel fucks up.

So about 2 months ago, I notice once again that my data is getting used up like crazy. Off I go to GlassWire to try to understand which app is responsible. Spotify again. You got to be kidding me. I am not listening to podcasts on my data anymore, so how is this possible? On top of that, the extra amount of data I was being charged coincided exactly with the TOTAL amount of Spotify data. So ALL my Spotify data is being charged. At this point I ask myself ""Am I paying for a plan that should include music data for free, but that is charging me for every single song I hear?"". Nah, cannot be. They must have messed up in their app somehow, it's a bug that does not count up my data correctly. I call them, and after 1 hour of this very patient lady trying to solve my problem, she finally agrees on giving me 1GB of data. That's nice, thanks, but it doesn't solve the problem that Spotify data is still being charged. ""Don't worry sir, that will not be happening again, you have my word"". Cool.

Immediately that day I check if the problem has been fixed, but it hasn't. I decide to wait until my next data cycle, maybe they needed to refresh the system or something like that. But even after renewing my entertainment plan, it kept happening!! I am furious at this point. I only got to call them today, and another very pleasant lady is assigned to help me. Once I explain the problem to her, she almost immediately tells me she will give me 1GB, but that I should be aware that that plan does not include Spotify data anymore. In fact, it hasn't been the case since 29th April, but the team is working to update the plan's description on the app. 

WHAT THE FUCK. 

This plan's description has not been updated in about 50 days, during which thousands of customers across Singapore keep on having their Spotify data depleted from their entertainment plans. I am sure I am not the first and I will not be the last to notice this, but how many of us would actually go through the effort of calling Singtel to solve the problem? Very few I'm sure. And why did the first lady not tell me this? By no means am I blaming her, but the fact that she did not give me that information can only mean Singtel did not want her to share it. She probably didn't even know about it.

Singtel is advertising a plan that is simply not true. It's a blatant lie, they are deceiving their customers, and what frustrates me is that *they don't care.* Telecomms do this over and over again, they stealthily introduce new fees, remove features, they do not warn anybody about it and hope that nobody notices it, making a shit ton of money in the process. It disgusts me. I had this happen to me and my close family multiple times, across multiple countries, it's like there's a freaking hidden book of how to be a telecomm and rule #1 is: be a greedy piece of shit and steal as much money from your customers when you can.

singapore,"As a long time redditor, I've watched many subreddits get extremely polarized and I see the same trend happening to this subreddit. 

I understand that the mods have a difficult job as it is and are doing what they can, but I feel that more needs to be done (by both users and mods) at this stage to curtail this shift to the extremes.
 
And what do I mean when I talk about this shift? The trend is especially evident in topics around immigration and, of late, cyclists. There are the usual posts highlighting examples that paint a negative light on these topics - and rightly so. A number of cyclists will be errant, some immigrants will have dubious degrees and some western 'expats' will act like dicks. But every time a 'negative' post on these topics is posted, a sizeable number of comments on the post sway the opinions of the neutral redditors or those whose opinions aren't yet fully developed on these topics in the wrong direction. I say wrong, because they simplify the problem and state their opinions with such disdain - when issues in real-life aren't as binary as they are made out to be. I am not saying that it is wrong to point out these examples or criticize them, but using broad strokes to paint the entire topic as 'good' or 'bad' just polarizes opinions and does not allow room for a nuanced discussion on these topics and what can be done to ensure that a reasonable solution can be reached. 

These are comments are from one post alone and have a good number of upvotes:

&gt;Maids are nice. Cyclists on the road who cycle for leisure are scum. Quite clear leh

&gt;Oh. The cyclist lived. Guess they'll never learn anything from this video

&gt;I don't care if the cyclists died because of their own fault.
&gt;But sadly, they get the drivers into trouble with jail or fine because of their actions. 

Remember the topics on immigration in the lead up to the recent elections? Or the one about the Indian expat verbally abusing the security guard? The number of comments from those who are clearly males, stating that they are second class citizens that get upvoted just reinforce that mentality and encourage xenophobia without allowing for a nuanced discussion on the topic.

Even more worrying is the trend towards dehumanizing of those who make (fatal and/or stupid) mistakes and trivializing them. Remember the elderly person who got died ‘jaywalking’. Or those 20-somethings who died in the BMW crash?

It is completely understandable that unbridled immigration (especially for mid-tier positions) will handicap the local populace, that cyclists who don’t follow the rules inconvenience and even put other road-users in danger, etc. But all rhetoric does is silence the voices of those who want to discuss on the factors that drive the phenomena and from those on both sides of the fence.

Let it be clear, what I’m NOT advocating for is censorship. And I am not stating I have the answer.

singapore,"In the video posted of LKY on LGBT rights yesterday, a few highly-upvoted comments characterized the PAP leadership as neutral to supportive on the issue and presumably ready to repeal anti-LGBT laws if only the majority of the population were for it. 

I am doubtful.

13 out of 20 members of the Cabinet are either Muslim or held the Bible in the recent swearing-in ceremony. Unless the Christian ministers attend the only LGBT-affirming church in Singapore, they are likely to believe in ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" and in conversion therapy.

Edit: Again, I emphasize the word ""likely."" I don't expect them to be the exception to the norm on the common position that Singapore churches have taken.

In this worldview, punishing the LGBT ""lifestyle"" is not being hateful to LGBT people. These ministers can—without uttering a single lie—say that they have LGBT friends and subordinates in real life so they do not discriminate against the LGBT. To them, there is no discrimination because they are only ""hating the sin."" They respect what the LGBT people in their lives bring to their friendship or work but conveniently remain silent about their disrespect for the LGBT ""lifestyle."" None of these ministers will feel like they are being hateful in retaining anti-LGBT laws. 

Moreover, this is not only a matter of simply pushing for what their religion wants. They share an entire worldview that says that gays can change the sex they are attracted to, and that given the right environment, no children will ""become"" LGBT. They see these as facts of the world in addition to their stance on the immorality of the LGBT ""lifestyle."" Therefore in weighing the pros and cons of repealing anti-LGBT laws, they will consider more children turning to the LGBT ""lifestyle"" as a (negative) consequence of that action.

Can we be sure that the current crop of PAP leaders is sincere in saying that the sentiments of the population are the only thing stopping them from tearing down the discriminatory laws? Anti-LGBT ministers would be pleased to rely on the same excuse to hide their true intentions while having the pro-LGBT crowd lap up the occasional ""supportive"" remark. I don't expect them to compromise their core beliefs by allowing kids to see positive depictions of LGBT characters on screen or by granting equal marriage rights to the LGBT. It will not happen without a shift in the religious composition of our leaders or without a shakeup in the Singapore churches' take on LGBT issues.

That's not to say that the opposition is definitely better. But those of us hoping for change should be more skeptical of claims that the PAP, or any opposition party for that matter, is secretly neutral or supportive of LGBT rights. 13 out of 20 of our ministers are probably anti-LGBT"

singapore,"Election season is upon us and with it, a metric fuckton of posts/comments about local politics. This issue is not unique to politics, but this is a great example of the issue with reddit's karma system.

Here I'd like to highlight three very recent posts, although I'm sure you can find many many more with a bit of digging:

\-  **GE2020: New PAP prospective candidates include former public servants, lawyer and banker** [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/heu61z/ge2020\_new\_pap\_prospective\_candidates\_include/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/heu61z/ge2020_new_pap_prospective_candidates_include/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

\-  **Workers' Party GE2020 releases new video titled Make Your Vote Count** [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/heuthm/workers\_party\_ge2020\_releases\_new\_video\_titled/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/heuthm/workers_party_ge2020_releases_new_video_titled/) 

The first two threads have 0 (basically negative, but reddit caps it at 0) upvotes while the third is probably going to get hundreds of upvotes (not confirmed yet but we'll know soon). 

Yet, these are all relevant pieces of news with regards to the upcoming election. As relevant as knowing who has been named in the starting line-up ahead of a big match, or a piece of news about how x player or y manager is doing.

Scroll down to the bottom of any politics-related posts here and you'll see people who support the incumbent stating their opinions (or sometimes, just straight-up lunatics). I would be alright if they were downvoted for saying things that are categorically untrue, but it's very often about contentious issues that haven't reached any form of satisfactory resolution.

Yes, I understand that the majority of people here support the opposition. Or, at least, that's what the karma system tell me. I know that the rest of reddit has a similar issue to this with its left-leaning majority and Trump supporters getting downvoted to oblivion.  

But!! This is the **Singapore** subreddit, not r/workersparty or r/PeoplesActionParty. This sub is hardly the last bastion of free speech in the world but it should not be an echo chamber especially at a time when we know that there will be polarising opinions. Some of us talk a lot about accepting differing opinions and being open-minded, but as a whole we still find a way to systematically remove opinions that we don't like. I don't think it is fair to the people who hold an unpopular and non-offensive opinion.

A bit of a personal take just to end things off: I may not like everything that the PAP does or that the opposition says, but it's fair to say that there is a level between being a fanatic supporter of either side. All of us should have the maturity to recognise that, and to respect the opinions of others who don't see things the way we do. Hopefully, we don't leave someone at -20 just because.

Not bashing anyone but do men in Singapore genuinely think this is funny? I mean, so many of the sexual harassment cases/voyeur cases that came out recently mention how the female victim is scared to call the police or are scared of the men assaulting her or scared that her claims won't even be taken seriously. Of course, the double standard definitely does exist and men also suffer from sexual harassment e.g. video cameras were placed in the male toilet in NUS halls but there wasn't coverage or action done about it.

However, shouldn't people be encouraging the men in this video to come out and talk about feeling violated or harrassed and then opening a conversation about men's emotional and sexual wellbeing in Singapore instead of just discrediting the women have in public spaces and the experience of reporting sexual harrassment?

singapore,"No, i am not from SAF. I am a Singaporean son that has served my duty to my country, with a few reservist cycles left.

The recent passing of the NSman from the lowering of the SSPH barrel is an unfortunate tragedy - but that is all it is. There is no blame to be placed, no accountability to be had, no good answers. 

Firstly, the NSman has had 2 years training on the SSPH platform during NS. He has also gone through 6-7 cycles of ICT - he is as familar with the platform and drills as he can be. 

When the incident happened, 2 other person were present - the detachment commander and the technician. The commander have been trained to look out for safety of the crew while carrying out the drills. The technician is essentially the system expert. These 2 people are as much ""human"" safety as you can ask for. 

Some people think the regulars should carry out the maintenance - this is wholly unrealistic in war time. There is a need for the gun crew to be self-sufficient. 

Some people ask for accountability - the immediate fault lies with the detachment commander and the technician, both are NSman as well. Do we expect SAF to give them up, and ruin the lifes of 2 functioning member of the society? Would that make future commanders more vigilant of safety, or more fearful such that they find ways to dodge NS altogether? Would the public accept this, or will they blame SAF further for ""pushing the blame to others""? Would that provide ""closure"" for the family?

Some people think that NS is unnecessary altogether, but it is such complacency that has lead to the fall of many city states in the past (eg. Venice). To put this in perspective, any singaporean man above the age of 21 can run up to any fallen Singaporean soldier, strip, assemble and load a SAR21 in under 5 minutes, and coordinate with any other soldier to defend our country. That is an incredible feat!

Assuming the investigation reveals that this incident is entirely the fault of the deceased NSman - should that be revealed to the public? Would the public accept that it's not some cover up?

Ultimately, the hands of SAF are tied. There is no good response for this incident. NS is a place to prepare for war time, and it is unrealistic to expect zero safety incidents, and with any degree of risk brings with it a degree of possible fatality. What we can ask for is due diligence, which has been fulfilled. SAF has not been negligent *specifically for this incident*. It is an unfortunate tragedy, and we should leave it at that. 

The internet is a wonderful place, but it can be a toxic place too. Just like you only see the good side of people's lives on social media, you only see the negative comments on news like this. The response is skewed because ""neutral"" people dont respond.

The food has been pretty good, though after 21 days it's quite repetitive. I will share the full room tour as well if allowed. 

Let us know if you have any questions Inside an SHN quarantine hotel for 21 days"

singapore,"Before you downvote this post please hear me out. I don't hate Singapore and I'm grateful for being born here. But I've told myself that I don't want to spend the rest of my life here and be buried here someday.

I'm currently 21 and now serving NS so it's not like I'll be able to go anywhere soon. But as a person who grew up spending too much time on the internet. My interests, ideas and views has aligned a lot differently from the culture of my own country. I've been obsessed with America, reading up a lot about it, watching too many videos, film and t.v about the U.S and I don't want to have shame admitting that I really like the U.S and really want to migrate there someday. Even my bunkmate has told me that I'm a person who was born in the wrong country cause I've ironically develop an American accent without even stepping foot in the U.S which people in N.S doesn't take kindly if you have a different accent.

I want to experience a lot of the things that they have there that I can't have here as a Singaporean because we are a small state with a lot of restrictive laws which made me really upset. 
That's not to say that I want to do drugs and all of those nonsense stuff but a lot of the things that I want are cheaper and much more accessible there that I'm willing to sacrifice some of the comforts here to move there.

And I know this is weird but growing up with gaming especially Tactical FPS games has made me obsessed with firearms that I started spending so much time watching gun Youtubers from the States like Hickok45, Garand Thumb, Larry's Tactical, Colion Noir that furthered my obsession with the gun culture the States have and I really wanted to be a part of that culture which is non-existent here and the entire region.

I've tried going to different subreddits asking for advice and a lot of people have been encouraging me to follow my dreams and move but obviously with most of these people being American they would be more bias about people liking their country. Someone even suggested enlisting in the U.S military with a green card but getting a green card is extremely difficult in the first place and I don't even know if I'll be enlistment age by then.

I've tried sharing this with my mom but my parents are extremely unsupportive of my endeavor and would just blare all the cliche arguments about why USA bad. And this has made me feel even worse if my parents are not even supportive of my life dream. 

I know this post has been going long but I've been keeping this in for awhile now and I just wanted to let it off my chest. I really wanna hear what is your input of this from as fellow Singaporeans and what advice can you give to help my feel less helpless. 

Thank you for reading this as this means a lot to me. I can't control what you say here but please be at least respectful in the comments...

Edit: Many of you has mentioned that the U.S is not like the movies of T.V shows and I'm aware of that. It's just that even all this I still feel like the flaws outweigh the pros for me living there.

singapore,"I thought for a while and hesitated about posting this but after thinking through about this again and again, I've decided to give my potentially unpopular 2 cents.

I do know that it's absolutely necessary for this Circuit Breaker. I do know that Covid-19 is a super tough SOB to fight. I do know that we have no choice because of many other reasons including people repeatedly flaunting the CB rules which partially caused this to extend in the 1st place.

I'm aware of the BBT ""last minute yolo party"" queue last night. While like many of the Singaporeans where I'm tempted to immediately scoff and jump in to criticize them, I thought for a while and decided to take a moment, and think through in regards to their situation, thoughts and feelings at that moment. 

Why do people seem to forgo all logic and common sense for something as trivial as a dumb cup of sugar, tea and boba? Why is it that we can still manage to stay home as much as we can but upon hearing about the non-essential F&amp;B ban, we lose all of our bearings and do ridiculous actions?

A lot of our lives have been disrupted out of the blue, with some of us handling it while others are breaking down entirely. You would see people doing funny stuff like using exercising as an excuse to go out, taking buses and intentionally going to far places, people using buying food as an excuse to go out etc. Does it sound stupid? Yes. But is it sad? Yes. Our lives have just been forcefully disrupted out of the sudden after all.

Also it's the 1st time that us as a nation, we had to observe such protocols in the longest time ever as a modern nation. Is this a #firstworldproblem ? Absolutely yes. 
But is it hard? Yes as well.

I'm pretty sure that many of us definitely have 1-2 snacks/comfort food of our liking/choice lying around at home such as loaves of bread, cakes, chips, crisps, soft drinks etc or whichever other sort of foods that you like during this period of CB. Now imagine having none of these for 1 month, and having to coop up at home + some of us facing personal issues or the aftermath of getting retrenched due to Covid-19. Would you be able to truly be alright, if this has been dealt to you on top of all the other stuff that has been handed to you?

In my humble opinion, food itself holds an important role even if we should be living to eat and not eating to live. Countless times in history have shown that food can make or break a nation/army. Food has been shown to be a mercy, comfort and deliverance for this harsh existence of our lives. Food has been made as our joy and blessing that we can afford to enjoy even in the toughest moments.

Thus, having thought all of these points made me feel sad and wanting to empathise with people instead of wanting to laugh/scoff/mock/scold them. It made me feel helpless about this pandemic as our hands are tied, yet we cannot do anything about it other than abiding by these extreme measures to combat this pandemic. It is all the more in such tough times that we as a nation should work together to support our brothers and sisters to overcome this together (yes, even the less bright ones). This saying is already overused and lame af but ""together we stand, divided we fall"" still holds true.

singapore,"I have been doing my finances month after month this year and realized that the expenses have come down dramatically due to the mandatory lockdown. If push comes to shove, you don’t really need more than a $1,000 to live a decent lifestyle in Singapore.

Assumptions..
- you have an HDB paid off
- living of your savings and CPF. i.e. ignoring the tax component as tax for first $20,000 is 0. So I have assumed that you are generating an income ~~20000~~ $10,000 per year from your savings/investments. $2,000 comes from CPF.
- Plus CPF monies are not taxable
- you are cooking at home mostly, which we did for the last 4 months
- one average meal at a restaurant per week
- health insurance is through CPF
- Not traveling internationally


Here’s what my calculation shows for 2 people..
- Grocery: $300
- PUB: $120 (with average aircon usage)
- Phones: $50 (for 2)
- Internet: $50
- Netflix/Prime: $ 20
- Public transport: $100 (for 2)
- Eat out: $200
- HDB maintenance: $50 (condo is $350, at least mine is)
- HDB property tax: $50*

Total: $940

Notes
- *I am not sure what HDB property tax would be but it should less than condos for sure.


Do note that this is a bare bone analysis which doesn’t include the usual e-commerce spend, changing phones every year, buying gadgets every IT show, going to pubs, etc.

Feel free to comment if I have missed anything.

Edit: People are commenting about lifestyle choices which I totally agree on. But this is a bare bone analysis of how things could stripped out to our basic necessities plus a little more.

Of course, lifestyle plays a big role. One can choose to have 3 lavish meals outside each week which would radically impact the numbers, or the staycation or the KTV trip :)

singapore,"With the number of 2019-nCov cases growing daily and the emerging reality of community transmission and possibly outbreak, I've been thinking lately did we really learn much from SARS? 

Yes the government did say that they learnt a lot and have made a lot of changes, but seeing how preventive measures over the past week or so were only put in place when things were getting serious and even until now our warning level is only YELLOW and not even ORANGE is certainly not comforting to us citizens at all. The current measures in place is simply not sufficient at the moment and any measures put into place hereafter is probably too late as signs of community spread &amp; outbreak is emerging. Even in schools the measures in place aren't enough to prevent a community outbreak. Are we just going to sit here with our ""lessons learnt"" and go through SARS 2.0, where innocent people die simply because not enough was done in time? 

The mask issue is also another worrying topic. While I do not competent disagree with what the government has been saying about usage of masks, at this current situation are we still supposed to do so? Especially on peak hours trains and buses where I've witnessed so many commuters coughing/sneezing without a mask or covering their mouth/nose, are we still supposed to ""not wear a mask if we're not sick""? Who are we to know that the one coughing is not someone infected?

Even if we decide to wear masks when commuting/in public places, we cannot even get masks now without paying scalpers insane prices for their stocks. Even stores now are upping their prices for masks and I've witnessed people queuing hours just to get them. Other countries have already prohibited increasing of mask prices, what's stopping us from doing the same?

Furthermore, we're being told all along that we don't need that many masks and that we have sufficient supply of masks; yet it's sold out everywhere and we are warned that if we do not use conservatively we would not have enough of a supply. Then why are we only told that we have sufficient supply of masks at the start and why aren't we told under what circumstances we can maintain that sufficient supply?

Sport for the long rant, I'm just really frustrated and afraid of what may possibly happen in the days &amp; weeks to come. I'm really afraid of a SARS 2.0 which is increasingly seeming like a possibility. I'm hoping that SG pulls through this fine and that we will all remain healthy. Please don't flame me, this is all simply my personal view and opinion and I do believe that the gov is trying to contain the situation and i'm not trying to insinuate hate against anybody as it does no good in this situation.",Did we truly learn from SARS?,"With the number of 2019-nCov cases growing daily and the emerging reality of community transmission and possibly outbreak, I've been thinking lately did we really learn much from SARS?

singapore,"I think we got a little complacent, the government should have barred travel to/from high risk countries earlier,  especially the european countries.

General Singaporeans are resuming their normal daily life. Hardly see anyone wearing masks nowadays. Social distancing is non-existant here. Schools still open. Malls still packed. It's as if Singaporeans forget that there are more active cases of infections now compared to when DORSCON Orange was announced. We rely too much on our government to handle the situation.

Just before the SHN from ASEAN countries was imposed, I was in Indonesia for several days. I see them practicing social distancing; staffs reminding passengers to not seat near each other and leave a seat in between unoccupied. Lifts have markings on them where people should stand  etc. Many more of them wearing masks. It's honestly quite surprising to me.

In European and middle east countries, schools are shut down. Any gatherings or events of over 100 people are banned. Mosques, Churches, club, schools are shut down.

Dont get me wrong, I think our government has been doing a great job overall. Especially in contact tracing and testing. However, I think they didn't properly predict how fast the virus will spread in other countries, and how it will affect us (globalisation and what not).

I'm afraid we are letting (or have let) our guard down.

singapore,"So here is my two cents to that video. After recent developments, I have to say I am slightly disturbed at the vitriol and abuse people online are willing to throw out. 

Firstly, what Ramesh did was clearly wrong. Using vulgarities at a security guard who was just following orders is wrong. Throwing around his weight and atasness is morally wrong and smacks of his low classness. 

However, the online mob's reaction is alarming, netizens are doxxing Ramesh, prank calling him and harassing him with vulgarities and violence. And because people are anonymous online (or at least they think so) they are willing to express more radical and extreme views that they would not do so in person. And there are some extreme views out there, which attempt to completely degrade people from an entire nation. 

There are so many uncertainties and info gaps in this whole issue. The video is not a complete video, no one really knows what happened before or after completely. So the context could be different. All the online leaks of his certificates may or may not be true. It is very easy to doctor documents. He may or may not have submitted fake documents from a degree mil. Why even the latest confessions from a current JP Morgan staff stating Ramesh is scumbag may or may not be true. That FB page was just created today, and has no other posts, looks rather suspicious and quite troll like. 

But all these has done is whip up the emotions of the online mob and Singaporeans at large. And it has brought up some sentiments and feelings that under the surface. It is like how the election of Trump energised the Nazis and white supremacists in US; they were always there. Trump just made it ok to voice such things out. 

Similarly, I worry that this incident has brought out some worms from the woodwork. 

All this emotionally charged thoughts and online sentiments might lead to someone actually trying to physically hit Ramesh. A bit like how Amos Yee was assaulted outside the courts. You can dislike a person, but it doesn't give you the right to threaten him or use physically violence. 

That being said, I'm sure the police and MHA are watching this very closely as this is a racially charged and social issue. Shanmugam has been surprisingly quiet on this issue. He is usually quite quick to comment on current issues. So I'm sure he and his ministry is watching this closely and the moment someone does smthg a little bit extreme,  like go and hit Ramesh, MHA will clamp down hard on that guy who commits violence and this online doxxing.

Rmb, doxxing is an offence so please dont do smthg stupid.

singapore," Very upset by tonight's MOH press briefing on case 44  for the sheer negligence of CISCO in not taking biosafety seriously and potentially infecting many, many Singaporean families. I really hope nothing happens and that community transmission didn’t happen.  


At the same time, I don’t see the newspapers asking hard questions that the public needs to know - at least release the dates, times of Case #44’s Chingay movements and deployment  so people can estimate their exposure risk. Please share this note so that we can get answers and actions that can possibly keep the many families that went to Chingay safe - or give them peace of mind that this is being handled with the seriousness and followup that it needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Background of Case 44: [MOH | News Highlights](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/one-more-case-discharged-two-new-cases-of-novel-coronavirus-infection-confirmed-10feb?fbclid=IwAR1CR_x95HFInqTkdxCaFC-eMcmHnIa6POz3jBKaDUtZZuwjxZ0-1eHNzPk)  
 Case 44 is a 37 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China. He is currently warded in an isolation room at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH).He reported onset of symptoms on 31 January, and had sought treatment at a general practitioner clinic on 2 February. He went to KTPH on 6 February where he was immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on 9 February afternoon.Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at Certis Cisco Centre (20 Jalan Afifi), and had been on duty at Chingay 2020. Prior to onset of symptoms, he had served Quarantine Orders on two individuals from Wuhan who were subsequently tested positive for 2019-nCoV. He had not served any Quarantine Order after onset of symptoms. He stays at Sembawang Drive.

I have a few hard questions today about CISCO and MOH’s handling of nCOV case 44

1. What biosafety measures and instructions are CISCO staff taking before, during and after serving the quarantine orders?
2. What kind of interaction did the CISCO officer have with the 2 patients?
3. Why was the CISCO officer not put in quarantine from their families or on restricted duties after working with potentially infected patients?
4. Whose idea at CISCO was it to place a person who was in relatively close contact - explaining the quarantine order - and then staffing one of the biggest public events?
5. Where areas and locations was the officer positioned while on duty at Chingay?
6. Should members of the public have contracted the nCov at Chingay, what measures are available to compensate them? Save for CISCO knowingly or negligently placing on duty a staff with exposure to nCOV at a large community event, thousands of members of the public would not have been exposed to this.
7. How many other CISCO officers are in similar circumstances of having served quarantine orders and then performed duties in crowds? What has been done to monitor or quarantine them?
8. Are there any other people served with quarantine orders that may have been infected by such CISCO officers?
9. What steps are CISCO amd MOH taking to prevent a repeat of this incident?
10. Should these duties of serving quarantine orders be better performed by SAF bio-chemical defense units?","Hard questions about CISCO, nCOV and Chingay"," Very upset by tonight's MOH press briefing on case 44  for the sheer negligence of CISCO in not taking biosafety seriously and potentially infecting many, many Singaporean families. I really hope nothing happens and that community transmission didn’t happen.  


At the same time, I don’t see the newspapers asking hard questions that the public needs to know - at least release the dates, times of Case #44’s Chingay movements and deployment  so people can estimate their exposure risk. Please share this note so that we can get answers and actions that can possibly keep the many families that went to Chingay safe - or give them peace of mind that this is being handled with the seriousness and followup that it needs.

singapore,"Today's number scares me: not by the digit, but the source of where the positive detected from. For the pre-school teacher's detection, I'm sure not many people had this fresh in their mind, that they queued up without safety distancing during the checks, as seen on this MS article:

[https://mothership.sg/2020/05/preschool-teachers-covid-19-test-queue/](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/preschool-teachers-covid-19-test-queue/)

&amp;#x200B;

We know that wearing mask **reduced** the percentage of spread, but social distance plays a part to **eliminate** the possibility of spreading. Even with masks on, at that kind of distancing practiced as shown in the article, even if I'm not a medical expert, I can probably tell that could be a potential issue resulted from that.

Are we ready to open up our country to ride on the picking up of economy, and risk having a 2nd wave outbreak? Personally I don't think so because:

1. Our economy is fragile: Certainly if there's a best time to open, that'd be to open ahead of many other countries. However, if we got ourselves in deep trouble due to 2nd wave, our economy will be even more impacted than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Our society is fragile: You can certainly see that the social distancing practice in this circuit breaker is having a significant effect. So why is it not 0 per day? Certainly, there are people (coined as Covidiot) exist that doesn't give a single care about this social distancing. The spreading is still there, there are still irresponsible people around.

3) Our enforcement is weak, not only society as a whole (yes, we, the people + enforcement agencies  + staffs etc), but we are not ready to condemn these people enough to bring the number to zero. We do not have the effective education among society to tell people to ""cover mouth when coughing"". What makes us strong enough to deter such practices should we spot one?

&amp;#x200B;

4) Our healthcare are stretched. We are certainly not ready to handle a sudden surge in the community when we are getting our hands full on dorms.

PS: I've got a lot more in my minds to share. Usually I keep it to myself cause I usually observe improvements in governance in our country, but this time round, I am afraid of what's going to happen once 2nd of June came, with the kind of case appearing yesterday to appear. That seemed to me like a ""Oh I read this article, what's the worse case it can happen for those people who don't practice social distancing cause of circumstances? Oh right, someone get positive for Covid 19, what else can it be?"" and the next moment, it became true.

I did not post this in view that I want the circuit breaker to continue for a little while more.

singapore,"Unlike the so-called popular ""unpopular opinions"" that this subreddit is known to conjure in the past, I have great confidence that this opinion of mine will be unpopular. **If you guys find this opinion substantive, even if you disagree with it, do give it an upvote so that others can see it.** I will speak in terms of both the monetary and the environmental costs. Anyways, let's start by talking about why the forest should be destroyed for residential purposes.

**1. It’s in a prime location for housing.**

Look in your satellite imagery. Stare at the forest. Do you see what's next to it? **Dover MRT station.** You rarely see these days that there are empty plots of land next to an MRT station. Especially in this central-west region. Imagine the number of people who will benefit from such convenience of living in some high rise property next to an MRT station!

**2. It is a way to promote social mobility.**

Many people do like the lottery effect, which such rare BTOs provides, for it is the only easy shot for such lower-income people to achieve social mobility. **Ask your conscience.** Is it right to take away this mode of social mobility from them, like how you have benefited from it, once upon a time? Many families' lives can be significantly altered because of this, and hence it shouldn't be taken lightly.

**3. Saving this forest destroys other forests.**

Remember the days where the beauty of Clementi forest was in the [news](https://mothership.sg/2020/10/clementi-forest/), and everyone was rallying for its conservation? Unfortunately, since then, the tunnel-visioning to preserve Dover forest has resulted in other more ecologically significant forest being neglected. As we speak, deforestation is happening on a much grander scale in Tengah than Dover would ever hope to experience. Why are we not worrying about that?

Also, Dover is not in a good state for preservation. It's not even a forest, but merely an abandoned plantation, with a sheltered walkway cutting it into two halves. **Heck, my secondary school has already eaten into a massive chunk of the forest.** It's not like you can integrate it into a nature corridor for animals which walk, at most it will be merely useful for migratory birds. Come on people; we can do better than to look at the low hanging fruit and forget that there are better ones out there worth preserving. Quite a considerable **opportunity cost** to save this forest, I'd say.

**4. Saving this forest causes more long term pollution through commutes.**

If Dover is preserved, the potential households who could have lived there will have to live elsewhere, further from the city. They will also contribute to the overcrowding of existing or future towns. And these additional, longer commutes from new towns that are further away than Dover, will lead to more traffic congestion, pollution, and energy consumption. Its simple secondary school Physics: **E = F•d.** More energy is required to accelerate the same mass of people over a longer distance. Until renewables power all our commutes, longer commutes from building elsewhere is worse for the environment in the long term, as everything is powered by fossil fuels. And if you speak in terms of monetary costs: Remember, people who live further away from the city pay more to get to the city; that's how distance fare works.

**5. Preserving this forest benefits the wealthy; destroying it reduces class segregation.**

This is not so much of a benefit of deforesting Dover, but it is one [food for thought](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/lanej6/rant_am_i_the_only_one_who_feels_as_though_the/). The people that benefit the most from the preservation of Dover forests are the wealthy landed property owners living up north, whose property prices will drop if high rise HDBs are built in the forest, due to a lack of privacy. The estate up north won't feel as exclusive anymore, with plenty of ""lower class"" people looming over their heads down south. [That's why there can often be violent objections to public housing built near landed properties in other countries.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eGTU_uXLKk) But, if you want to ensure greater social cohesion and reduce the level of class enclaves in Singapore, this is one way to encourage their intermingling.

==========

And now, to address common objections against developing HDB flats in Dover Forest.

**1. Why don't we stop importing foreigners?**

First of all, if I'm not wrong, purely foreign households cannot buy HDBs, so stopping the import of foreigners isn't going to make any difference in this case. Maids live with Singaporean households, and foreign workers live in dormitories. So they aren't exactly contributing to the spike in the domestic public housing demand, are they? **(Mic drop)**

Anyways, recently [CNA ran an article](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hdb-household-smaller-size-multi-generation-sample-survey-14160170) on a changing taste and preferences of Singaporeans when it comes to the household structure, and Singaporean households are getting smaller, with more one-person households and fewer inter-generational households. That may explain why there are still more and more households even though the population of Singaporeans living in HDB flats is getting smaller. If you are always looking for people to blame for this issue, you can blame Singaporeans like you and me.  So now we've got the xenophobic argument out of the way. Next!

**2. Why don't we develop elsewhere, like golf courses?**

**Surprise, surprise!** We've been doing that this whole time! Guess what? [It has been going on for a while now.](https://www.todayonline.com/sports/govt-reacquire-land-2-golf-courses-3-give-land)

However, there are limits to what can be done with golf courses. Let's look at some of the far-flung one like those in Tanah Merah or Tuas. **Touch your heart and ask yourself, do you seriously want to live there?** There are a few problems. Firstly, for those far flunked regions, [a commute to the city will easily take an hour.](https://medium.com/@yinshanyang/isochronic-singapore-a-gentle-introduction-to-isochrone-maps-9cceebc72f60) Those who live deep in Pasir Ris, Sembawang, Jurong West, and those far flunked new towns, I can feel you. It's a tragedy. Ideally, it will be great to minimize the number of people living that far from the city, which will add even more to the congestion and crowdedness of commutes, causing even more pollution. That's why we should develop Dover Forest.

Secondly, urban planning is a complicated subject; there's a reason why the golf courses are allocated to be in such geographically useless locations. **This makes its redevelopment tricky.** For example, those golf courses in Tanah Merah are right under the flight paths of Changi Airport. Can you imagine the noise pollution level that the residents have to bear if they live under the runway? What about the one in Tuas? Bear in mind that Tuas is a heavy industrial area that may have quite a bit of pollution. [If the pollution from Pasir Gudang at Punggol is already that bad](https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/hdb-punggol-pasir-gudang/), imagine living next to the factories in Tuas.

And for those people citing Sime Golf Course as a potential location for residential given its central location, I don't think it's a good idea to live that close to our biggest nature reserve. The environmental destruction caused by human activities on our biggest nature reserve won't be negligible. Also, some plot of land nearby has already been zoned for residential, so now you have your answer.

**3. How about we use those empty plot of lands or abandoned buildings nearby?**

Firstly, **how sure are you** that the plot of unused land will stay unused in the future? Just go and look at the [URA Master Plan](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/) and you can tell that every inch of land in Singapore has a purpose of its own. Eventually, even that plot of land that you cited is going to be used as well. And before you accuse me of a false dichotomy, well the thing is, I'm not even presenting you a choice on where to develop. It's not a matter of what; it's a matter of when. The plan all along is to have enough land to carry out this development cycle until the first of the 99-year leases run out.

Also, not all plots of empty land should be used immediately. There is always a need to have some vacant land plots everywhere, which can be tapped on in case of emergencies. Remember the migrant worker Covid-19 fiasco? The government had to allocate spare land to build some middle-term dormitories, and there's one at [Choa Chu Kang Grove](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/migrant-workers-move-into-first-quick-build-dorms) which you can see from the train between Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations, sitting on vacant land. If there wasn't any vacant land, how would they be able to build these quickly? Also, you need some space for election rallies. Yeah.

**4. Why don't we just en-bloc old buildings and build higher?**

Anyways, when environmental enthusiasts mention the word en-bloc, you will bring a new point of contention with heritage enthusiasts. **Environmental and heritage conservation, they are often in conflict with each other.** With each en-bloc, some of Singapore's cultural heritage gets destroyed and will never be seen again. [Would it not be sad if you look back one day and there aren't any real tangible objects in the form of point and slab block HDBs you can be nostalgic about?](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/partial-conservation-dakota-crescent-gives-heritage-enthusiasts-hope)

Besides that, one does not merely demolish HDBs and build something with an even greater density in it. You have to remember, that when you build 4 times higher, you generally have 4 times the amount of people living in the same amount of space, the traffic that the roads and public transport network below it increase multifold. Can the streets handle such traffic? If not, can they be widened? Are you able to build more MRT lines to take additional commuters? And do you have space for more bus transportation?

It is also observed from artist impressions that [flats in Dover forest will be about 30 stories in height.](https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/ulu-pandan-bto-flats-2021-prices-hdb/) So, don't worry about the plot of forest land being poorly-utilized.

**5. Wouldn't the destruction of Dover forest worsen the urban heat island effect?**

That's one valid argument to preserve Dover forest. **But I would say that's a reason to destroy Dover forest as well.** Perhaps not in its entirety; the northwestern part of the forest, which is much less fragmented, still has some preservation value. But think about it. By destroying a part of the forest, you maximize the number of Singaporeans who can enjoy the lowered temperatures that the forest's remaining sections provide. It will no longer be an exclusive thing for the wealthy landowners and those living east of Clementi, but for these new Ulu Pandan HDB owners as well. Wouldn't that be great?

==========

Hope we can have a constructive discussion below in the comment sections regarding this alternative point of view that seems to be out of most people's mind.",Unpopular Opinion: Dover forest should be destroyed,"Unlike the so-called popular ""unpopular opinions"" that this subreddit is known to conjure in the past, I have great confidence that this opinion of mine will be unpopular. **If you guys find this opinion substantive, even if you disagree with it, do give it an upvote so that others can see it.** I will speak in terms of both the monetary and the environmental costs.

Hey, so a friend is a transguy and passes very well, too well in fact. He ends up confusing people because he's very tall and quite manly looking.

He has a female marker on his ID, and he doesn't want to/can't get a hysterectomy due to the risks ( family has risk factors that would lead to complications if he got one, not stating for anonymity). He also lacks funds for phalloplasty or metioplasty and finds getting a job hard due to his mismatch inbetween his IC and physical looks.

This had made getting a job and interacting with people hard, so he wants to change the gender on his IC. After COVID he plans on getting top surgery, and I'm wondering if his Thai surgeron (Dr. Kamol writes him a letter stating he has completed sex reassignment surgery, with the specific terms), he'll be able to get my gender marker changed.

Info online is hella spotty at best and doesn't say what surgery is needed to change your gender, but only a letter is needed from a medical professional.

So yeah, I would love if a fellow transguy or two could give my friend some help here...  Its hard to get a job when you're tall and manly but that ID reads F.","A transguy and wants to change legal gender on my ID, but not sure how?","

singapore,"The makeshift bridge between the MRT station and bus interchange at Jurong East is exactly why we need architects and designers.

I’m a Civil Engineering undergraduate (currently interning) and I don’t particularly like the industry to be honest. Responsibility of the structural integrity of the building lies on the Structural Engineer, and the Earthworks on that of the Geotechnical Engineer. We churn out challenging and technical designs day in day out, and somehow get paid far, far less than an architect (cantilever, what’s gravity, ship on three curved sticks, pretty building).

But looking at the bridge mentioned, it’s pretty apparent why we need these people with artistic flairs. I absolutely detest how gravity-defying some of these designs are, but I guess it’s very much needed. Without them, we’ll get smooth and efficient - but uninspiring, monotonous and unchallenging infrastructure.

For those who don’t know what I’m referring to, you’re not missing out on much. It’s simple I and H beams bolted together with your typical truss design. It looks like an eyesore, really.

singapore,"For context, I'm a 16 year old student who has just completed my O's. I decided to spend my holiday working for a bit of extra pocket money.

The job is simple, we help to sell items for different schools. Having had experience from being a sales girl last year, this was no big deal for me and I cope with the job well. 

I have always been in ""名校"" (what some consider good schools) since I was in primary school, and most parents of the children I knew in those schools were amiable, pleasant people, so I used to refute the stereotype that parents from more elite schools were arrogant. 

My view changed in less than a week of work. I hate to admit it, but most of the difficult parents are those whose children are from the ""good schools"". 

On my first day of work, I had a nasty parent who openly told her son ""You have to wait, she's not smart you know."" simply because I had to confirm that the sample size I gave them was correct with the full time workers at the counter. 

Although I had been briefed, I just wanted to ensure that I provided the correct information and was doing my job properly. It doesn't mean that I'm stupid or dumb. (Besides, if I did something wrong instead of clarifying my doubts, wouldn't I be in even more trouble?) 

For example, let's say Happyland is a really well known school. 
There's Happyland Primary, Happyland Girls School, Happyland High School and Happyland JC. 
The parents of Happyland have the tendency to go into the store and scoff ""Happyland."" when I ask them which school's items they are looking for. Upon asking them which Happyland School they are referring to, they would instantly look offended as if to say ""Don't you know *Happyland*?"" 

The usual condescending tone is expected, but the attitude they give is rather unnecessary. I'm a sales girl and my job is to help you. It won't hurt to give me more details about your child's school so that I can serve you better. 

Some parents would brag about their children to other parents who they know are parents of children who are going to neighbourhood secondary schools, instantly changing their tone and attitude the moment they come into contact with another parents whose child is attending the same school as theirs.

 C'mon, they're just here to buy items for the new school year, not start a whole conversation about how your child is better because their T score is a 270+ 

The parents are nice to me (their tone actually does a 180) when they ask me which school I go to and find out that I've already accepted an offer from a ""good"" JC. 

Are they implying that they're only nice to me the moment they find out that I'm going to a ""better"" school than their child? 

Your child's brand of school doesn't make you any better than others. 

Over the last 5 days, I realised that many of the parents who were nice to me in school were probably nice only because they know I'm at the same level and their child and would like their children to be treated with respect as well.

 It is a common assumption that sales girls are people who have low levels of education and it isn't the highest of job titles, but it doesn't mean that they are subhuman trash. (this applies to everyone with a job people ""look down"" on) 

I know many of you here on reddit would think I'm spoilt and can't take being treated rudely because I'm part of the ""strawberry generation"" and am just being easily offended and triggered by the slightest of things. 

This post isn't about me. It's for the full time working ""aunties"" who have to deal with the attitudes of these people on a daily basis. 

I'm starting to really empathise with those who have to deal with these elitists who think they're better than everyone else simply because of the school their child goes to. And honestly, even as a student from one of such schools, it really isn't that big a deal. You aren't superior. 

I'm not trying to say ""all schools are equal"" and I understand that elite schools exist to separate children of different levels of intelligence so that they can learn better amongst peers that are similar to them.

 I just hope that people treat others with more basic respect, there's no need to turn your child's education into some complex politics. 

Please teach your children to be nice to people, and do it by setting a healthy example. 

Edit: I apologise if my tone is inappropriate or rude. If I get downvoted by a bunch of defensive parents, so be it.

singapore," Why is there no one standing up for Male equality in singapore. Even if there may have been, they will be laughed at and overall treated as a joke because “how can men be disadvantaged in society right?” “Stop whining and man up!!!!”

These are a few examples on how men have been systematically(?, not sure if right word don’t POFMA) disadvantaged.

\-NS. I know this has been repeated for very long. But I feel that people who have not served NS do not understand the true impact on mens careers. Why would any rational company hire a male who has 2 years less experience compared to all of his foreign and female peers AND has to “waste” 2 weeks of precious work time reducing overall company productivity. They will obviously want to hire foreigners or even better females so that they can score diversity points and get benefits from hiring a singaporean.

This is best put from u/plstellmewhyitisso



1. one is a 25 year old local grad, 0 years experience, asking for x salary  
 
2. Another is 26 year old foreigner, college grad, 3-4 years experience and asking for x salary  
 
3. Another is 26 year old non-ns female, college grad, 3-4 years experience and asking for x salary plus playing the Women In Tech card and gender diversity card  
 

Why would anyone hire 1???

In todays super competitive world, isn’t this an EXTREME disadvantage? Moreover, the NS pay is literally peanuts, barely enough to pay for food.

Even more examples (100% credits to u/appletree911

These phenomena are not merely just socio-cultural but are perpetuated by truly sexist legislative and institutionalised policies.

For instance, male preschool teachers are often subjected to abjective limitations with regards to internal gender-specific protocols devised by such institutions. They are not allowed to perform routine care (showering, changing of diapers etc) and have tight restrictions with regards to their physical interactions with children. Conversely, female staffs are not subjected to these limitations. Both genders went through the same training, possess the same qualification and demostrated competence executing their functions, and yet these male teachers are systematically side-lined, solely by virtue of their sex.

In Singapore, it is undeniable that females are accorded more rights and protection whereas males are burdened with more liabilities. Let me list some of these examples. Bear in mind that all of these are not merely ambiguous social protocols but legislated and institutionalised policies.

S375 of the Penal Code

The offence of rape is gender-specific. A woman cannot be charged with rape, regardless of how heinous a sexual misconduct she commits.

Amendment to S376 of the Penal Code

Prior to Jan 2020 (before the recent criminal law reform), a woman who 'rapes' a man (forces a man to penetrate her with his penis) cannot even be charged under S376 (sexual assault involving penetration). Hence, she can only be charged under S354 (outrage of modesty), which carries the maximum sentence of only 2 years imprisonment. In contrast, a man who commits exactly the same offence is deemed a case of rape, which carries the maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, a difference of a factor of 10.

Repeal of S509 and enactment of S377BAof the Penal Code

Prior to Jan 2020, males are not protected under the insult of modesty (non-physical sexual harassment) law. In fact, prior to the establishment of Protection from Harassment Act in 2014, there is seemingly no legal recourse for males if they are subjected to non-physical harassment. Currently, women are still more protected than men from modesty related offences.

Laws such as S27(1)(d) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act and S4 of the Defamation Act are gender-specific and only protect women.

S377 of the Penal Code

No provision pertaining to the deviant act of sexual exploitation of a corpse by a woman exist. Under the current legal framework, S377 (sexual penetration of a corpse) applies explicitly for males only. A woman who employs the penis of a deceased man to sexually penetrate herself on her own accord is seemingly not liable for any legal repercussion.

S377A of the Penal Code

Male homosexual acts of any nature (even private acts) are condemnable under the law (outrages of decency) whereas female homosexual acts are not subjected to this abjective limitation.

S366, S372, S373, S373A of the Penal Code, Part XI of the Women's Charter etc

Most laws protecting victims of prostitution are gender-specific and are only accorded to females.

S61 of the Education (Schools) Regulations

With regards to medical examination in school, consent from girls over the age of 10 is mandated under the law if they are to be examined by a male person. Consent from boys over the age of 10 (or of any age for the matter) is not mandated under the law, regardless of circumstances.

S83 of the Criminal Procedure Code

With regards to body searching, a male officer can only conduct searches upon a female person if he has strong reasons to believe that she is a terrorist and that she is about to carry out an act of terrorism. Conversely, no such limitation is imposed upon female officers and they are empowered to conduct searches upon persons of any sex, regardless of circumstances.

S69 of the Women's Charter

A woman is eligible to file for spousal maintenance against her husband regardless of circumstances. However, a man is only eligible to file for spousal maintenance against his wife if he is permanently incapacitated before or during the marriage and by virtue of his incapacity, he is rendered permanently unable to maintain himself. A woman is also eligible for file for nominal maintenance in cases where her earning capacity is similar or higher than her counterpart. A man is not accorded this right.

Gender-specific financial schemes Schemes such as Working Mother's Child Relief, Basic Childcare Subsidy, Foreign Maid Levy Relief and Grandparent Caregiver Relief are only applicable for mothers. Even single fathers are not eligible for any of these perks.

Unequal parental leave

Mothers are entitled to 16 weeks of paid maternal leave whereas fathers are only entitled to 2 weeks of paid paternal leave. It must be said that a recent change in policy has allowed fathers to 'siphon' up to 4 weeks of paid parental leave from their counterparts, subjective to their partners' concurrence. However, only married fathers are entitled to paid paternal leave and shared parental leave. Mothers are entitled to paid maternity leave, regardless of marital status. Moreover, fathers, even single fathers are not entitled to paid adoption leave. An adoptive mother is entitled to 12 weeks of paid adoption leave. A married adoptive father is entitled to 4 weeks of shared parental leave, subjective to his partner's concurrence. A single adoptive father is not eligible for any parental leave aside from paid childcare leave.

S4(3) of the Adoption of Children Act

A single man is not eligible to adopt a female child unless in 'exceptional circumstances'. Conversely, a single woman is free to adopt a child of any sex.

Termination of Pregnancy Act

A father has absolutely zero prenatal parental rights but is subjected to the full spectrum of parental liabilities. A mother can, with her unilateral decision and without the consent or even knowledge of her counterpart, goes for an abortion and deprive her counterpart of his child, regardless of the father’s wishes or means. A mother can also, on her own decision and without the consent or knowledge of her counterpart, delivers a child, in which her counterpart is expected to fulfill his legal and moral obligations to be responsible for the welfare of the child, regardless of the father’s wishes or means. This is true even in cases whereby the child is a product of sexual assault perpetrated by the mother. The fundamental principle here is 'my body my choice'. Principles such as 'our child our choice', 'my money my choice' and 'its life its right to live' are of little significance.

S53(e) of the Penal Code and S325 - S332 of the Criminal Procedure Code; S88 of the Education (Schools) Regulations

Only males are subjected to institutionalised corporal punishment (judicial, military and school caning) in Singapore. Females are not to be caned under any circumstances. The principle of equal liberty and liability is of little significance when it comes to gender.

National Service

Only males are required to serve their mandatory obligation to the state. This is despite the fact that the stature governing the policies of national service (Enlistment Act) is gender-neutral and seemingly applies to all persons, regardless of sex. Persons who completed their mandatory service and persons who are exempted from service are accorded the same statutory rights and privileges.

“Equality”

 Ong Ming Wee, who was acquited of rape.

He was even sentenced as guilty by a feminist judge and had to get the verdict overturned thanks to Subhas.

The woman who made the false rape claim was never revealed and paid no damages to Mr. Ong, who had to suffer damage to his reputation and paid huge legal fees.

Only men and boys are allowed to be caned.

Personal anecdotes from some redditors

When I was in Primary 3, there was an incident where an intense fight broke out between a girl and a boy in my class. The brawl arose as the girl had deliberately taken and damaged the boy’s treasured Pokémon cards. Thankfully, none of them sustained any serious injuries. For punishment, both were made to write lines. However, on top of writing lines, the boy was publicly caned whilst the girl was not subjected to additional repercussion. Just before the caning, the disciplinary master publicly admonished and degraded the boy on stage, chiding him for being a scum for raising his hands upon a girl. No such reciprocal statements were made upon the girl, who was sitting right there in the crowd watching him get caned. After the caning, he was made to vow on stage not to lay his hands on a girl ever again.

The poor boy was only nine then. How does one expect him to have a healthy and balanced view of society, or to believe that as an individual, he is equally precious when he was subjected to such blatantly unfair treatment and disregard solely due to his sex? Unfortunately, after that incident, he developed severe apprehension and a searing hatred for school and authority. This was despite the school management admitting negligence on their part and had profusely apologised to him and his parents. - u/appletree911

This occurred more than two decades ago. Back then public caning was employed extremely liberally, especially for my conservative Chinese school. The blatant display of preferential treatment for girls was also ridiculously evident.

Boys were severely punished for lightly teasing girls but the reverse cannot be further from the truth. In fact, during those days there was a popular ""prank"" where girls will pull down the pants of unsuspecting boys. All this warrants for is a good laugh at the expense of the boys' fluster and humiliation. Can you imagine the armageddon if the reverse was to happen?

I have a mate who had ended his own life at the tender age of 15, with his public caning being probably the last straw. People often just think of the physical aspects of caning without much consideration for the modesty of the subject and the emotional harm that comes along with it, especially for public caning, where one's ""manliness"" is publicly trialed in the presence of his peers. Yelping or displaying any sign of weakness often leads to bullying and belittling.

Moreover, for my school, in cases of class or public caning, girls have the option of retreating from the class/assembly after the announcement of a boy’s offences, if they were uncomfortable with the situation. On the other hand, it was mandatory for boys to sit through the entire process to be ‘educated’, even if they may feel uncomfortable too. I vividly remember an instance of public caning back in primary school where a male pal of the boy being caned broke down and sob inconsolably in tandem to the cries of his friend on stage, both of which garnered jeers from their fellow peers. Only then was he allowed to leave with the escort of his form teacher.

As bewildering as it may sound, a friend who was caned and cried on stage described to me that he hoped he was raped instead. That really took a toll on me. It really caused me to be vehemently against caning. Think about the scene of judicial caning for instance, where the subject is stripped naked, bound to the trestle, being forced to adopt such a degrading posture and lashed like a beast in a room full of strangers, sometimes with persons of the opposite sex. I firmly believe that if you do not punish one with rape, you do not punish one with caning. - u/appletree911

When I was in primary school, my male teacher would hit the hand of any boy that did anything mischievous as a form of punishment with the long classroom ruler. If a female student did something mischievous, the most he would do was scold - u/Thefearlesscow


Do we just accept it and suck it up?

""Honestly I have being lurking forever but NS is always the ugly head that will appear eventually. Why? Singapore's TFR is currently at 0.87 courtesy of CIA (link below). It means we are at a very real threat of having not enough people to perform NS duties in a few decades time.

So the govt will have to seriously consider either fix the problem or ""outsource it"". I mean who likes NS and asking girls to go for mandatory NS is something I wish for no-one. After all I finished mine and I don't want the next generation to suffer.

But until NS is abolished, it will remain a sore point and a potential population issue in the future. And let's not forget that we had several horrific accidents (Aloysius pang anyone) in 2018/2019. So NS isn't exactly a walk in the park either.

singapore,"It’s so upsetting to see fellow Singaporeans acting nastily to the foreign workers in Singapore. 

On one hand, we find it outrageous when one of us is attacked or bullied over in Australia and London. Yet, when you look at the situation locally, our behaviour is no better. 

Sure, we don’t express our racism by means of force or violence but the way we treat foreign workers are inexcusable. When Covid started, there were implicit acts of racism towards Mainland Chinese. 

With the dormitory situation now, we have Singaporeans talking down to these workers. Especially in the video where a Chinese dude approached a pitiful Indian man (I’m guessing construction worker) walking about without his mask. Yes, it’s illegal and it’s alright to approach him to ask him to put on his mask. But, couldn’t the guy have done it better? There was no need to scream at the man or degrade him with phrases like “are you educated” etc. 

Furthermore, the Indian man was passive the entire time and even started addressing the perpetrator as ‘Sir’.

singapore,"Hi everyone, title says it all. I recently went through an abortion and I thought I'd write this down to pen down my thoughts and what I went through, and also to share this with women (and men even) who might be terrified and going through the same situation. **I'd like to clarify though, that I do not encourage abortion.** I'm just here to share the details on the whole procedure, should you have no other choice but to go for one. 

When I first found out I was pregnant, I was scared and confused. I immediately turned to online to seek for advice and to read up on stories and experiences of women who have went through abortion in Singapore. However abortion remains a taboo subject in Singapore and I couldn't find much information about the details of the procedure. I found some old stories on Reddit however, but most of these abortion posts are from years ago, and it made me wonder if the procedure is still the same now. I went ahead to the clinic not knowing what to expect. I was terrified. So here is my attempt at sharing my experience since this just happened today, and hopefully it'll benefit someone who has to go through this. 

I 99% confirmed my pregnancy on 18th April through a pregnancy test kit. My period has always been regular so when it was late for 4 days, I knew something was not right. I went down to the nearest 7-11 and bought a pregnancy kit (Predictor brand) and the result was a very very faint second line. It was so faint that I couldnt decide if it was just my imagination, or if it was really there. I prayed that it was just my imagination and went to sleep, hoping that I would wake up to my period. That did not happen, and I went down the next day to buy the Clearblue Digital Kit, which would tell me straight up if I was pregnant or not pregnant (so get this kit even tho it's slightlyyy more costly) No doubt, I was pregnant.

A long discussion happened between me and my partner. It was a very very painful and heartbreaking decision and for many nights I cried myself to sleep. 

During my first appointment, my gynae did an ultrasound and confirmed my pregnancy. Seeing that tiny dot on the screen broke my heart. I couldn't bear to look at the screen for more than a few seconds :( This circuit breaker also made everything tougher than it already was. My partner was not allowed into the clinic with me. I had to go through all of this alone but I guess in a way, it spared him some pain / heartbreak since he didn't get to see the ultrasound. The first appointment was a breeze. I was in the clinic for around 20 mins only. See the doctor, get an ultrasound, ask him any questions you have about the procedure, make payment and schedule my procedure. There was also some paperwork involved, I had to write down 3 lines: ""I wish to terminate this pregnancy. I do not want this pregnancy. I am aware of the risks involved."" Yikes.. :'( 

After payment, the nurse prescribed Misoprostol, a medication used to soften your cervix. I was told to take this 2 hours before my procedure so that my cervix would be ready for the surgery. (Side note: yes there are 2 types of abortion in Singapore, namely medical and surgical abortion. Medical abortion is where you rely on just pills to ""induce"" a miscarriage, but I've heard that it might be extremely painful, you will bleed alot, you might vomit and get chills, and since I stay with my family I didnt want to take this risk. There is also a risk that your uterus doesnt completely empty itself and you may then have to go back for surgical abortion again to vacumn everything out. Surgical abortion is done under sedation, and a vacumn is used to suck out the pregnancy sac. This would be way faster, and painless as well.) My procedure was scheduled for 2 days later at 930am. I was told to start fasting by 530am, and take misoprostol at 730am.

2 days later, (i.e this morning), I woke up at 7am and got ready. The pills were to be taken orally, placed under the tongue, and then i was to wait for it to be dissolved. It was tasteless, just very powdery and chalky. 30 mins after, I started developing a fever. I could feel my body burning up and I started trembling like maaaad. There were however no cramps and I was not bleeding as well. I got to the clinic at 9am and got my temperature taken. True enough I had a fever of 38.1 but they told me it was one of the side effects so it was ok. We made payment first before I was led to a room to put on a gown. This room had 3 beds in it and I believe it is for patients to rest in after the procedure. After changing into the gown, that was only when i felt the first gush of blood. 

I was then instructed to lie down on a bed while the nurse took my blood pressure and also monitored my heart rate through this clip on my finger. I could hear the machine beeping very fast because I was panicking so so bad, haha. I was also struggling to not cry and she must have sensed it because she was so reassuring. She then proceeded to prepare to inject the medicine into me through a butterfly needle to put me to sleep. Afterwards, I had zero recollection of what happened. It was around 940am when she injected the sedation meds into me, and when i woke up at 10am, i was already back in the resting room, lying on the bed with my belongings. No idea how i got back to the room, because while i was resting, i saw another girl being helped over by a nurse. I dont even remember walking back. Did they carry me?! No clue, but only 20 minutes had passed. I was a little groggy so i closed my eyes for another 5 mins before i got up to change and leave.

Reached the clinic at 9, left the clinic at 1015am, got home by 11am. Cramps were very very mild (I hope I dont jinx this), but I started bleeding. The bleeding however is very similar to period bleeding. I was also told to go back for a post-review 10 days later to make sure that my uterus is completely cleaned and there is no more pregnancy.

I paid $2,210 for everything and used $900 from medisave. 

I am still feeling very heartbroken and empty and I cant stand looking at myself in the mirror because i feel horrible. Sometimes I feel fine and try to understand why I made this decision, but sometimes I can't help to wonder about the what could have beens.

I hope this post helps anyone who has to go through an abortion. This has been the most traumatic experience in my life (emotionally) and I will remember it forever.

TL;DR - sharing my surgical abortion experience in Singapore.


EDIT: to clarify, we used contraception but there is no contraception that is 100% effective. my gynae has spoken to me more on the different types of contraceptives and their effectiveness, and I may consider an alternative method which is way more effective, but that will have to wait until I am fully recovered from the surgery. the most common contraceptive option used is still the male condom, but if you ever use it incorrectly, chances of the woman getting pregnant increases drastically. my gynae has recommended longer term options, such as a contraceptive implant, which is inserted under the arm to prevent ovulation. this lasts for 3 years. another alternative would be the IUD which is inserted into the uterus, this can last up till 5 years. 

**thank you everyone for reading and for your kind comments, and for standing up for me. I shared this in fear of attracting negative feedback but the support I've been receiving through both the comments &amp; DMs have been overwhelming. thank you to all who have chosen to be kind in this trying period. i do not consider myself to be a heroine, just to clarify. going through an abortion is nothing to be proud of. the emotional torture that one has to go through - i wouldnt even wish this upon my worst enemy. this post is again, to give details on my abortion experience for anyone who may be online looking for help, advice or support, and to also remind all of us that there is no method of contraception that is 100% effective. low chance doesn't mean no chance, and especially if it's for a risk you're not prepared for, it's not worth taking.**

some people have also dm-ed me personally to share their stories and support and i appreciate that very much. please feel free to dm me if you need to talk, I'm all ears.


stay healthy always everyone. Just to reiterate - I do not encourage abortion. I just hope that if you're reading this and you are considering an abortion, please make sure you've given proper thought over it. At the end of the day, i just hope that you make a decision that you can live with. 

UPDATE - one month post procedure, even though there were feelings of relief, I've also been feeling a lot of self blame and guilt. And I wished I could have done things differently.

However, I'm wondering if it is indeed true that anime is more of a niche interest in Japan than mainstream, does that mean Japanese live action television and movies are not as sexually suggestive?

To clarify, I do not intend any shade thrown towards Japanese society here. American live movies and TV shows after all have gotten very risque in the 21st century (see Game of Thrones).

japan,"Yesterday I got a Pfizer vaccine shot via a cancellation waiting list, but before that I did some research on vaccine reservations at local clinics to try to figure out which places would be most likely to have lots of reservations and some vacancies. The info is no longer of use to me, but I figured it might be helpful for someone else.

In the weeks to come, more and more people under 64 are going to get coupons. As a result, many clinics will re-open reservations for a new wave of patients. But Reservations for this summer are going to fill up fast when that tidal wave of new coupon-holders hits. The faster you can make a shortlist of clinics in your area that are likely to still have shots and get their websites bookmarked so you can be on top of updates, the better your chances of snagging a reservation spot before August and getting to enjoy at least a bit of your summer.

First, Try googling “キャンセル待ち” + your area and do a direct search for cancellation lists. At any given time, most websites will say they are overwhelmed with requests and have closed the list for the time being. Don’t be discouraged. Bookmark those websites and check each of them every morning. Eventually they will open up for a new round of reservations, and when they do you will be on top of it.

If that doesn't work, you will need to start calling clinics looking for open reservations; most don't even have online reservations, let alone online waiting lists. 

Make sure you start with the list of participating clinics on your ward's website. You can also track them down on yahoo maps by doing a search on ワクチン：

https://map.yahoo.co.jp/search?q=%E3%83%AF%E3%82%AF%E3%83%81%E3%83%B3&amp;lat=35.67861&amp;lon=139.76533&amp;zoom=14&amp;maptype=basic

If you're lucky you may have 200+ clinics in your area. Even if you were inclined to call them all until you got a reservation, by the time you found the right clinic they could already be booked. Here's how to target clinics most likely to have a spot for you first.

The situation on the ground:

Mostly, the main clientele at doctors offices is old people because they need the most medical attention. So they are not just the governments priority, they are the clinics priority too, because they represent the repeat business.

As a result, most of those clinics have booked appointments solid for old people well into the future. They have more regular elderly clients than they do reservation slots, and so their treasured elderly clients get all of them. You probably won’t be able to get a reservation at most typical clinics until late July at the earliest, maybe August or worse.

The other issue is that a lot of doctors are really busy with full waiting rooms every day anyway. Even if they are officially participating in the program they are not making it a priority and have not set aside that much time to do these vaccinations in the first place. My family knows a doctor in another ward who sees the clinic’s order forms for his area, and not all orders are equal, some order hundreds of shots per month, some just a few. My regular clinic is only doing vaccinations two Sundays per month, 30 people per day. For him it is just extra work to do on one of his days off and he seems to be putting in the minimum effort.

So, two things to look for when you go through the list of (hopefully) one or two hundred clinics in your area, looking for a rare still-open reservation in that haystack:

1) doctors that don’t have a lot of elderly patients

2) doctors that have small numbers of high profit patients, rather than large volumes of relatively low profit patients

A perfect place to find a reservation: a women’s fertility clinic. They are like a car dealership: high profits off the clients they have, but still lots of downtime where nobody is there. And there aren't a whole lot of old people using a fertility clinic. There are a few that are doing lots of vaccinations five days a week during their downtime. Another one we found that looks promising is mostly plastic surgery.

Since those are few and far between, a good fallback is pediatricians. Both their clients and clients’ parents are non-elderly. They have higher volumes of patients, but at the very least you can get a fresh start near the front of the waiting queue, rather than be told that an entire summer worth of reservations have already been taken up by elderly patients who had a head start of a couple months to book.

Im sorry if this question has come up before, but Ive tried researching and it has been hard to find any concrete information for some reason. Id like to get tested for STDs and STIs preventatively, as I dont have any symptoms and never had, but just for peace of mind my partner and I would like to get tested. All we have found is extremely high prices in clinics ranging from 6000 to 9000 yen per single test item and I find that hard to believe, since in my country it is free to get tested preventatively.

So I bought several Japanese pencil extenders at a bookstore in Seattle.

The packaging was 100% in Japanese, of course I threw it away.

They are the most amazing pencil extenders I have ever seen, I really want more.

I looked on the bookstore's website, and I couldn't find them.

Does anybody have any ideas where I can buy Japanese Pencil extenders online?

japan,"**EDIT:** Okay since there have been a lot of comments about it... no, Interac didn't actually tell me that they stole my cat... he's just missing and I assumed that they have stolen him since they told me to get rid of him! I can't think of anything else that could have happened.

I've been working in Japan as an English teacher for almost 5 years now. Currently, I'm employed by Interac, who takes care of my apartment (it's a Leopalace).

With the Coronavirus pandemic, I've been stuck inside pretty much 24/7. I begrudgingly go to work, but make sure to complain often to my JTE about how we shouldn't be here. Then it's straight home, and no outings, only take-out food, no visitors ect. Can't believe people are taking things so lightly...

Anyway, I could spend a whole another post ranting about COVID haha. The point of this post is I've been lonely at home all this time so I thought I would get a pet of some kind. My apartment has a strict no-pets policy and even after begging Interac to allow it, they still wouldn't budge!

So I said ""F U!"" (figuratively) and about three months ago bought a cat from a pet shop anyway (his name is Nyaanta). Everything was fine and dandy for a while, but about a month ago Nyaanta started getting REALLY loud whenever I left the apartment. One of my neighbors must have heard and complained to the apartment people because next thing you know I'm getting a call from Interac demanding that I get rid of my cat!!!

I of course told them no, and that there's nothing they can do about it. Well a couple days ago I come home from work to find Nyaanta GONE!! I was freaking out until I got a call from Interac telling me that they had confiscated him because it breaches my apartment contract.

Since they don't have pet shelters in Japan, I'm really worried that they are just going to let him loose on the street or something.

With the Coronavirus pandemic, I've been stuck inside pretty much 24/7. I begrudgingly go to work, but make sure to complain often to my JTE about how we shouldn't be here. Then it's straight home, and no outings, only take-out food, no visitors ect. Can't believe people are taking things so lightly...

Anyway, I could spend a whole another post ranting about COVID haha. The point of this post is I've been lonely at home all this time so I thought I would get a pet of some kind. My apartment has a strict no-pets policy and even after begging Interac to allow it, they still wouldn't budge!

So I said ""F U!"" (figuratively) and about three months ago bought a cat from a pet shop anyway (his name is Nyaanta). Everything was fine and dandy for a while, but about a month ago Nyaanta started getting REALLY loud whenever I left the apartment. One of my neighbors must have heard and complained to the apartment people because next thing you know I'm getting a call from Interac demanding that I get rid of my cat!!!

I of course told them no, and that there's nothing they can do about it. Well a couple days ago I come home from work to find Nyaanta GONE!! I was freaking out until I got a call from Interac telling me that they had confiscated him because it breaches my apartment contract.

Since they don't have pet shelters in Japan, I'm really worried that they are just going to let him loose on the street or something.

What legal options do I have to get my cat back from my employer? Please help! Help! My employer stole my CAT!"

I'm trying to find the name of a Japanese festival(?) activity(??) that I possibly saw in anime as a child. I haven't seen it in newer anime so it's possible that it's an older activity?

Basically, I remember seeing these little balloon-like things on a table. They look like they're being inflated? I drew a picture on MS Paint, something like this:

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/548958156693307395/848704025109069904/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/548958156693307395/848704025109069904/unknown.png)

If this was just an anime thing, not even Japanese, or some weird fever dream of mine when I was a child, I'm very sorry.

Thanks so much if you can help. Obscure Japanese festival activity?"

I bought a huge stack of novels at book-off last time I was in Japan, but I've finished most of those, getting printed books shipped from Japan is expensive, and besides I prefer reading on kindle anyways. The problem is that the selection on the japanese amazon kindle store is often seriously horrible. Even hugely popular novels for some reason just don't get released on kindle until years later. Like the last \~5 Murakami novels aren't available on kindle. The Detective Galileo novels aren't available (except Yougisha X). Out of the Akutagawa prize winners of the past 10 years or so, maybe 30% are available. I'm not looking for super specific niche things from a hundred years ago. I've also tried bookwalker, but it's pretty much the same.

I'm assuming this is just a case of Japanese companies being Japanese and weirdly technophobic / traditional? I mean you see loads of people with e-readers on every train in Japan, so I don't think it's lack of customer demand, but maybe Kinokuniya and Junkudo and all the other huge bookstores have exclusive contracts with the publishers? Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has had the same problem and whether there's a super-secret Japanese ebook store that I don't know about, or some niche workaround involving a VPN, a Tsutaya account, a burner phone and a faraday cage, or maybe some tiny little company in the US or Europe that sells Japanese-language ebooks internationally...

Salesforce chief technology officer Parker Harris said on Twitter that the company was experiencing a ""major disruption"", later updating to say services had been mostly restored. Japan's coronavirus vaccine booking system crashes"

japan,"Hi all, i recently stumbled upon an ebay auction for an old japanese synthesizer, suiko brand ST-40. as far as i can tell, it is a traditional japanese music themed synth (with a main Koto sound, various taiko sounds and other general non-descript mellow synthy sounds) designed to accompany haiku readings. however, i cant find a lot of information on how exactly this would be used, is music usually a very important part of Haiku ceremonies? any info on how haiku and tea ceremonies work and how music is incorporated etc. is more than welcome, this is such an interesting tradition and i was so surprised to find that a synth like this even exisits.

japan,"My girlfriend who is a Japanese national from osaka was just denied boarding on two flights back from Turkey (where we spent the last couple of months cause I myself, European, can not go back to Japan) despite having a perfectly fine throat &amp; nasal swab PCR. First flight with Emirates was because she didn't use the correct ""form"" which the hospital has to write down the test results (No joke!) and it gets even worse. So after being denied boarding, she did another PCR test at the airport, the doctor filling out the form for her, and today, now with Air France, she was denied boarding AGAIN. Because she not only has to use the ready-made form, she also has to do it as a designated hospital in Istanbul. She has now been spending 2,5 days at the airport, which is already quite a horror, and now her next flight is on third of may. She called the japanese consulate and embassy today to ask which hospital that designated hospital is--guess what: They didn't know. There is no information about this what so ever anywhere in Japanese about this (the form, yes, we managed to find that very well hidden information AFTER we got told by the Emirates-staff), let alone in English.

This has been a nightmare, my girlfriend was crying non stop for half an hour (I managed to get back home to Europe easily with a regular PCR test JUST AS IT SHOULD BE) and I hope this information will help anyone who is about to fly to Japan. You can ask me questions.

This is the information about the form (dated 28. April) [https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page25e\_000334.html](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page25e_000334.html)

The information about the designated hospital--well, we haven't found it yet. Only Air France told us she can't fly cause she has to do her PCR at THAT, and ONLY THAT, hospital (nobody at Air France knew exactly which, but they assumed it was the American Hospital). (At the embassy they told her a few Japanese citizens got turned down IN JAPAN because of not having had their PCR done in that hospital. Also, they didn't know exactly which hospital)

This is the most ridiculous chicanery I ever heard of, total kafkaesk and bordering to harrassment. It virtually doesn't make any difference which form a PCR result is written on.

EDIT: Thanks for all the support, it was really helpful. I found this information in the group posted by a redditor (thanks!), it's about all the details regarding the PCR [https://www.facebook.com/groups/returntojapan/permalink/1120455351785651/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/returntojapan/permalink/1120455351785651/) (Not sure if you need to join the group first, but it's up to date information) IMPORTANT: For everyone who's going to Japan, it is absolutely recommended to join this group and read this information. You'll find a list of countries and the clinics that offer the correct tests required by Japanese govt. Save yourself a lot of hassle, time and money. Good luck!

EDIT 2:  I found this really useful! Japan requires Nasopharyngeal swabs to enter. Some labs (as we found out) perform ""nasopharyngeal swabs"", but just write ""nasal swab"". Also, problems could arise if it's a combined throat &amp; nasal swab, which is also not allowed according to several sources. So please make sure and tell the lab in advance that they MUST write nasopharyngeal swab, and not just nasal swab. This little detail can mean all the difference between being allowed or denied boarding!",Japan's entry requirements are absurd.

japan,"Sorry for the depressing topic, but I just watched the Japanese movie ""Shoplifters"" which is really great and highly recommended.  Only problem is that the ending:

&gt;! is extremely depressing; an neglected and abused little girl is returned by the police to her abusive parents, even though she was missing for 2 weeks and the police knew the parents didn't even care enough to file a missing person's report!&lt;

I researched a little to see how exaggerated or accurate this movie was to real life, and found this very depressing article:[Why Japan Keeps Returning Abused Kids to their Parents Until They Are Killed](http://www.japansubculture.com/child-abuse-in-japan-why-japan-keeps-returning-abused-kids-to-their-parents-until-they-are-killed/).

It mentions that Japanese Child Protective Services (CPS) are very understaffed and undermanned. And there was a famous case in 2018 of a little girl suffering abuse until she died.  And that Japan unfortunately has more child abuse cases per capita than many other countries and even more CA cases in total than a larger country like the US (where CPS intervenes earlier).

The only positive in the article was that many people in the society were shocked and saddened by this case. So maybe things have gotten better in the past 2 years? Has the Japanese CPS gotten a bigger budget? Have the Japanese police and judiciary become more active in intervening and stopping CA?  (Another article says sentences for CA have gotten harsher since 2011, but it doesn't seem like much.)

I really hope someone who speaks Japanese or is up-to-date with Japanese news media can please update me on this situation.

japan,"Well, as a disclaimer, I'm mixed (hafu) and brazilian, but I come from a japanese family, due to the south america japanese diaspora as you might know, and I believe that can be relevant to the discussion. I'm not talking about nationality, mostly about identity, and I'm aware I am not japanese, but japanese-brazilian.

My family came from the main island of Okinawa in 1934, and I know Okinawa used to be part of the Ryukyu Kingdom that existed prior to the Meiji era, and it was made a vassal by Satsuma clan in 1609 and then formally annexed as a prefecture of Japan in 1879. I believe you know the story.

Where I live there's a strong okinawan community, alongside a huge mainland japanese community which reunites people from many prefectures in one place, so I've been to matsuris that involved many prefectures together, also many neighbourhoods don't tend to have this distinction between *yamato* and *uchinaanchus.* In short, I've been raised among brazilian + yamato + uchinaanchu culture.

My grandmother speaks japanese, and although she understands okinawago (as she calls it), she can't speak it. She also doesn't cook typical okinawan food, but cooks kare, norimaki, onigiri, manju, etc. My family went to work in Japan for a couple of years and then returned. A couple of relatives still live in Mie prefecture, some moved recently to Brazil as well.

My question is, I see that much of Okinawan culture in the media is not what I'm used to, and I don't feel *that much Okinawan*, but at the same time I don't know if that's quite right, and I would like to know if someone else feels this way.

I understand Okinawa IS JAPAN, and Japan is not so homogenous as media generally portrays, but some people put so much emphasis in being Okinawan and not Japanese, not that there's anything wrong with that, absolutely not, but I don't feel the same way as they do, and **personally**, I feel more japanese than uchinaanchu per say, does anyone else feels like this? Am I doing something wrong?

In conslusion, I usually describe myself as japanese AND okinawan in background.

japan,"Because of that Minami Minegishi thing, i've decided to read more on AKB48. Spent a week reading books and stories on them, and how they were made and how Japan sees them. And thus, it came to this conclusion:

AKB48 is a huge scam designed to fork out money from wotagei idiots who don't care about talent and that Yasushi Akimoto is the greatest scam artist after Deepak Chopra, Adam Sandler, Richard DeVos and L.Ron Hubbard.

Basically, Yasushi Akimoto took a bunch of talentless female hacks and combine them all to create the most talentless idol group ever created in order to get easy money from idiots in the cheapest way possible.

And combine it with the best delusional marketing campaign ever (""Idols you want to meet!"") and the money will keep rolling for ever.

And he's good with this. He has experience running an idol group with Onyanko Club. But this time, he does it with one target: Wotagei/idol otakus who don't care about talent or quality and are willing to fork out as much money as they could for the sake of their idols because they're too dense and too stupid to realize that the money mainly goes to Akimoto and not the idols.

And i can see Akimoto pitching the concept of AKB48 to Japan inc:

""Hi, i am Yasushi Akimoto. You might know me for creating Onyanko Club. But this time, i want to create a new idol group, and it doesn't require any talent whatsoever. We're gonna have lots of members more than Onyanko and Johnny's idols, and this will be very cheap because we don't give a fuck about talent and quality due to the fact that our main target audience will be idol otakus who would buy anything with cute looks over talent, and with that we will get rich and make loads of money from this idol group and from the idiots who buy and obsess over them. And let's not forget all the CMs and sponsors we can get!""

Seriously, it's genius. Is this like the greatest scam ever conceived in East Asia. Forking out money from morons by creating a talentless idol group led by hundreds of cute girls is great. Now, i might be wrong and i don't have the facts from Akimoto's head. But, a scam would perfectly describe AKB48 wouldn't it?

tl;dr Have had 34 apartments reject me just because I'm foreign.","Finding apartments is unnecessary difficult in Japan, when people reject me for being foreign","I'm no stranger to racism in Japan. I live in the countryside at the moment (ALT), and I experience it on almost a daily basis: people crossing the street from me, not sitting next to me on the train, getting on a completely different carriage when they see me - I've even had someone tell their children not to get too close to me and my friends (foreign). 

However, I'm currently searching for apartments in Tokyo, and I need to rant about this. I went through forty properties over the last 5 days, and only six of them have been okay for foreigners.

It's absolutely disgusting that I even have to take this into consideration. I've been through three different agents who all gave me the same thing. I wanted to just shout at these ignorant people down the phone, saying it's 2016, the Olympics will be here soon and who do you think is teaching your Children English.

japan,"I was thinking to myself how most porn has terrible acting on anything besides the sex. If there is any story whatsoever, it usualy comes out as cheesy and totaly fake, no ""suspension of disbelief"" is archieved.

Then I remembered about hentai, where english dubs are even worse than live action porn, but the original in japanese always sounds authentic.

Then it got me wondering if the reason for that might be because I cant speak japanese at all. 

So, for all the japanese-speaking-hentai-loving out there: is voice acting in hentai usualy good, or does it sound totally fake like most porn? 

Do hentai voice actors/actresses earn good money, comparable to normal anime voice actors? Can they easily get non-adult anime gigs normaly or is it like, once you voice hentai you are shunned and cant get work in normal anime? Is hentai voice acting a taboo?

japan,"Hello everyone,

Am a 21 y.o male living in the netherlands that will go (through an exchange program) to Japan for 6 months. I don't have any connection with Japan and I never was really planning to go to Japan but I made a mistake in exchange program form :,), nevertheless after some talking with students and teachers I planned to go anyway. 
(I actually had no choice haha..)

So the first step ofcourse is to acquire some information about Japan/living in Japan/ culture and before i realised i got really interested and excited to go. I kept on looking for more info on this reddit page and it gave me some kind of image of what i can expected.

However tho, I believe in the islam and from what i have read is that drinking in Japan is extremely populair. I don't mind going into a bar with friends/students/colleagues, i don't mind that people are drinking and are having fun. Its just I do not want to come over as a twat that doesn't drink and be rude &gt;.&lt;. I have no idea how to avoid that. Also, I don't eat all kinds of meat (only if they are ""Slaughtered in an islamic way"") but fish is no problem.

Is that my biggest concern? No, islam has been covered a lot lately in the news and people are genuine afraid for it. I don't blame them after all the events and all the reports. I believe that these people that do these horrible act are hiding behind a faith.. Anyway after some research I found an article of islam in Japan which didn't really put my mind in ease. 

It stated:
""...Japan is known as a country with the least appreciation of Islam: Japan is the only country in the world that gives no citizenship to muslims and forbids for muslims to spread the Islam. The country has barely any embassies in Islamic countries and the vast majority of the Japanese population agree that Islam itself is a very narrow-minded religion...""

It's not that I am walking casually around the neighbourhood shouting: "" am a muslim! Be aware and respect me!"" Ofcourse not. It's just in the 6 month I probably will be put in a situation where I have to say: ""am sorry, am a muslim and i can't not eat/drink that."" Am afraid that they will instantly dislike me or worse :(.

Is there anyone with tips/advice or experience on what i can do? 

Thanks in advance :D!

Making this a self post just 'cause...

This is a little out there for this sub since neither music nor videos of any kind are posted very often, but I thought some of you might find it interesting on one level or another. I'm a musician who's been in Kobe for the past eight years, and have the rather dubious distinction of being one of the few blonde Alaskan foreigners writing Japanese rock songs in deep Kansai dialect.

Some background: I used to be in a band called ヒダリ. We had some minor success and did a couple nation-wide releases on the same label as Quruli that never really took off, but allowed us the opportunity to tour from Sendai to Fukuoka and hit Tokyo about once a month or so.

You can see me here in our ode to wine:

Here's a cover of a みんなのうた song we did for a compilation album. You may recognize it if you've been in country for a while:
[ヒダリ - メトロポリタン美術館](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiR0fWQ8IQ)

I quit the band years ago, and have been working solo for the most part. I've been fortunate to play a few large festivals in Kansai, including Comin' Kobe this last Tuesday, whose attendance was estimated at 35000 people. (It was probably less than that due to the pissing down of rain, but still...)

Which brings me to the point of this post...

Shooting was done by holding my iPhone at arm's length and praying my head was in frame and in focus for enough of the take that I'd have some usable footage. Editing was done by trial and error. But I'm rather proud of it, despite that.

This post is partly shameless self-promotion, but I'd mainly like it to be educational since most of you aren't really my target demographic. (Which is drunk Japanese 30-somethings, I think?)

japan,"My girlfriend has this perspective and bias that Japan is the best place to live and best of everything. It gets really annoying. I wanted to present some claims she has made and I want those who lives in Japan or had lived in Japan to evaluate these claims to provide me some insight.

&amp;nbsp;

Before I get into that, I want to provide some background about my girlfriend. My girlfriend is 25% Japanese and was born in the US. She has relatives in Japan in Hiroshima. As a child she has lived back-and-forth between the US and Japan. When she became established, she lived in Japan for 10 years and has a degree in Japanese study. She can speak Japanese fluently even with the Japanese accent and everything just to clarify that she is not a weebo. She definitely knows her Japanese history and has a love for history in general. Due to personal reasons, she unfortunately had to return to the US and experience cultural shock when she found American unmannerly and rude. She was not used to live back here in the US. This is when she became jaded and developed this hatred towards the US and Americans, and always likes to point out how Japan is superior than the US in every way possible as if Japan is heaven and there is no single flaw.

&amp;nbsp;

As for me, I am also born in the US too and I am half Chinese and half Vietnamese. I am not racist against Japanese but I just find it so annoying when I hear her one-sided perspective and bias.

&amp;nbsp;

According to my girlfriend:

&amp;nbsp;

1) ""Japan is so much nicer. In Japan, people are generally more mindful and well-mannered. Compare to here in America where we live in Chicago, we have these stupid hoodlums, thugs, rude fat white people, teenage girls that get pregnant at a young age. In Japan, it's way much different.""

&amp;nbsp;

2) ""The police here in Chicago and in America in general are a joke. Some of them look out of shape. How are they supposed to run to catch a criminal. The physical that cops need to take probably have low standards in order for them to pass.

&amp;nbsp;

In Japan, they do not use firearms because they are actually trained to learn martial arts. Also, there is like a police booth around each corner of each street in Japan. They also make a huge announcement that the curfew hour is about to begin and everyone who is not of age should return to their homes immediately.""

&amp;nbsp;

3) ""The doctors are better in Japan. The doctors here in America are a joke and do not even know what they are doing. These days you see these nurses or RNs (registered nurse) with tramp stamps and tattoos. You get multiple doctors looking at one patient's record and do not even know what they are doing.

&amp;nbsp;

Also in Japan, there is free medical insurance.""

&amp;nbsp;

4) ""The food in Japan is so much better with higher quality and there food ingredients are fresh.""

&amp;nbsp;

5) ""In Japan, everyone keeps to themselves. No one is rude and butts into your business because in Japanese culture, everyone respects each other's privacy (part of being polite)""

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 1:**


6) ""The services at stores in Japan are way better than service here in the US because in Japan, the employees work hard because the Japanese believe that the work they perform reflects what kind of person they are and their reputation so they do their best to deliver the best service to customers unlike the US.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 2:**

7) ""In the US here, they do not help the homeless. In Japan, there is a shelter or a place for the homeless to go to and they pair the homeless people in Japan with jobs base on their skillset or what they are capable of to provide a way for them to get back on the feet. In the US, you are left out to die if you are homeless.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 3:**
I did not expect this to blow up and receive this many responses. I am sorry that I cannot respond to each one of you, but I do appreciate everyone's input and I do enjoy reading everyone's comments. I am sorry if I offended anyone. I do not have hatred towards Japan, but I did wanted someone to clarify these arguments my girlfriend had about Japan. If course I couldn't confront her due to get bias.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you everyone. I am still going to continue to read everyone's input :) 

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 4:**
I need to clarify a huge misunderstanding here. I am aware that my initial post came off like ""Japan is not any better than America"" or ""America is better than Japan"" or that I am some crazy angry person who hates Japan.

&amp;nbsp;

**Disclaimer:**

* I do not hate Japan. America is not better than Japan, nor is Japan is better than America. Every country has its ups and downs. For me to claim that one country is better than another country without experience living in both countries will be a poor judgment and very immature on my part.

* Do not confuse my girlfriend's hatred to America as my own perspective towards American lifestyle VS Japanese lifestyle. That is my girlfriend's attitude towards America. Do not perceive it as my own.

* I would like to live in Japan and experience it myself to experience to understand the culture myself. There are many things in Japan that I find interesting and I believe it will be a very insightful experience regardless if I have to go through the good and bad.

* When you have a girlfriend who is not Japanese but lived in Japan for 10 years who is bitter about being forced to move back to US away from Japan which was more fitting towards her preference, and argues everyday or every other day how America is a shithole compared to Japan, it gets pretty aggravating. I do not hate America. I do not hate Japan. I am upset at my girlfriend's unfair judgment because every country is not perfect and to say one country is better than another without providing a fair analyze and pros and cons for both sides, all you will see is a bitter and ignorant person with a poor sense of judgment. What is worse, that person is my significant other. Thus leading to the creation of this post because I just needed to get this off my chest and verify if what my girlfriend say is actually true.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 5:**

With all the responses and input, I think I have a better understanding why my girlfriend behaves the way she does now. Typical American behavior here annoys her because she is very used to Japanese people being ""polite"" or putting on a persona of being polite.

&amp;nbsp;

She hates human interaction here in America and prefers the self-service machines/robots in Japan because it's more satisfying for an end-user or consumer like her. She has that ""Get out of my way"" mentality ""I am here to get into the store. Buy my stuff. Get out. Don't need to deal with no human error from a cashier or clerk. Such convenience and more comfortable to do things on my own pace operating a self-service machine/robot than working with a human cashier or clerk.""

&amp;nbsp;

She rather have phony smiles and accommodation from customer service from stores and shops than honesty. At least she gets good services and her customer needs are met. That is more important to her and they get the job done regardless if the employees have to be fake.

&amp;nbsp;

Even though most of you say that the Japanese police do not do anything. I think my girlfriend likes the delusion and comfort from the thought simply knowing there is a police booth nearby, regardless how effective the Japanese police are, compare to not having any police around compare to here in Chicago. Having police nearby gives her a peace of mind regardless of their effectiveness.",Validate my girlfriend's claims about Japan,"My girlfriend has this perspective and bias that Japan is the best place to live and best of everything. It gets really annoying. I wanted to present some claims she has made and I want those who lives in Japan or had lived in Japan to evaluate these claims to provide me some insight.

&amp;nbsp;

Before I get into that, I want to provide some background about my girlfriend. My girlfriend is 25% Japanese and was born in the US. She has relatives in Japan in Hiroshima. As a child she has lived back-and-forth between the US and Japan. When she became established, she lived in Japan for 10 years and has a degree in Japanese study. She can speak Japanese fluently even with the Japanese accent and everything just to clarify that she is not a weebo. She definitely knows her Japanese history and has a love for history in general. Due to personal reasons, she unfortunately had to return to the US and experience cultural shock when she found American unmannerly and rude. She was not used to live back here in the US. This is when she became jaded and developed this hatred towards the US and Americans, and always likes to point out how Japan is superior than the US in every way possible as if Japan is heaven and there is no single flaw.

&amp;nbsp;

As for me, I am also born in the US too and I am half Chinese and half Vietnamese. I am not racist against Japanese but I just find it so annoying when I hear her one-sided perspective and bias.

&amp;nbsp;

According to my girlfriend:

&amp;nbsp;

1) ""Japan is so much nicer. In Japan, people are generally more mindful and well-mannered. Compare to here in America where we live in Chicago, we have these stupid hoodlums, thugs, rude fat white people, teenage girls that get pregnant at a young age. In Japan, it's way much different.""

&amp;nbsp;

2) ""The police here in Chicago and in America in general are a joke. Some of them look out of shape. How are they supposed to run to catch a criminal. The physical that cops need to take probably have low standards in order for them to pass.

&amp;nbsp;

In Japan, they do not use firearms because they are actually trained to learn martial arts. Also, there is like a police booth around each corner of each street in Japan. They also make a huge announcement that the curfew hour is about to begin and everyone who is not of age should return to their homes immediately.""

&amp;nbsp;

3) ""The doctors are better in Japan. The doctors here in America are a joke and do not even know what they are doing. These days you see these nurses or RNs (registered nurse) with tramp stamps and tattoos. You get multiple doctors looking at one patient's record and do not even know what they are doing.

&amp;nbsp;

Also in Japan, there is free medical insurance.""

&amp;nbsp;

4) ""The food in Japan is so much better with higher quality and there food ingredients are fresh.""

&amp;nbsp;

5) ""In Japan, everyone keeps to themselves. No one is rude and butts into your business because in Japanese culture, everyone respects each other's privacy (part of being polite)""

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 1:**


6) ""The services at stores in Japan are way better than service here in the US because in Japan, the employees work hard because the Japanese believe that the work they perform reflects what kind of person they are and their reputation so they do their best to deliver the best service to customers unlike the US.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 2:**

7) ""In the US here, they do not help the homeless. In Japan, there is a shelter or a place for the homeless to go to and they pair the homeless people in Japan with jobs base on their skillset or what they are capable of to provide a way for them to get back on the feet. In the US, you are left out to die if you are homeless.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 3:**
I did not expect this to blow up and receive this many responses. I am sorry that I cannot respond to each one of you, but I do appreciate everyone's input and I do enjoy reading everyone's comments. I am sorry if I offended anyone. I do not have hatred towards Japan, but I did wanted someone to clarify these arguments my girlfriend had about Japan. If course I couldn't confront her due to get bias.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you everyone. I am still going to continue to read everyone's input :) 

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 4:**
I need to clarify a huge misunderstanding here. I am aware that my initial post came off like ""Japan is not any better than America"" or ""America is better than Japan"" or that I am some crazy angry person who hates Japan.

&amp;nbsp;

**Disclaimer:**

* I do not hate Japan. America is not better than Japan, nor is Japan is better than America. Every country has its ups and downs. For me to claim that one country is better than another country without experience living in both countries will be a poor judgment and very immature on my part.

* Do not confuse my girlfriend's hatred to America as my own perspective towards American lifestyle VS Japanese lifestyle. That is my girlfriend's attitude towards America. Do not perceive it as my own.

* I would like to live in Japan and experience it myself to experience to understand the culture myself. There are many things in Japan that I find interesting and I believe it will be a very insightful experience regardless if I have to go through the good and bad.

* When you have a girlfriend who is not Japanese but lived in Japan for 10 years who is bitter about being forced to move back to US away from Japan which was more fitting towards her preference, and argues everyday or every other day how America is a shithole compared to Japan, it gets pretty aggravating. I do not hate America. I do not hate Japan. I am upset at my girlfriend's unfair judgment because every country is not perfect and to say one country is better than another without providing a fair analyze and pros and cons for both sides, all you will see is a bitter and ignorant person with a poor sense of judgment. What is worse, that person is my significant other. Thus leading to the creation of this post because I just needed to get this off my chest and verify if what my girlfriend say is actually true.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit 5:**

With all the responses and input, I think I have a better understanding why my girlfriend behaves the way she does now. Typical American behavior here annoys her because she is very used to Japanese people being ""polite"" or putting on a persona of being polite.

&amp;nbsp;

She hates human interaction here in America and prefers the self-service machines/robots in Japan because it's more satisfying for an end-user or consumer like her. She has that ""Get out of my way"" mentality ""I am here to get into the store. Buy my stuff. Get out. Don't need to deal with no human error from a cashier or clerk. Such convenience and more comfortable to do things on my own pace operating a self-service machine/robot than working with a human cashier or clerk.""

&amp;nbsp;

She rather have phony smiles and accommodation from customer service from stores and shops than honesty. At least she gets good services and her customer needs are met. That is more important to her and they get the job done regardless if the employees have to be fake.

&amp;nbsp;

Even though most of you say that the Japanese police do not do anything. I think my girlfriend likes the delusion and comfort from the thought simply knowing there is a police booth nearby, regardless how effective the Japanese police are, compare to not having any police around compare to here in Chicago. Having police nearby gives her a peace of mind regardless of their effectiveness. Validate my girlfriend's claims about Japan"

japan,"Long-time Okinawa expat here. Been lurking reddit for years, getting tired of seeing misinformation every time Okinawa comes up, so here's a little rundown for those who are interested. 

Source: Living in Okinawa since 2004. American but no connection to the military. I teach at one of the local universities here. Living out here because my wife is local Okinawan and her family is here. She's a doctor here, I met her at a conference in Hawaii many years ago. Not big on debating politics, but it's annoying to see clear misinformation being spread around, hence this post. 
  
Rationale for posting: 99% of Americans that speak up on reddit about Okinawan issues are military related. Here's the thing - military related folk don't have an entirely unbiased view. Thought experiment: a group of mostly 18-25 year-old people, mostly from rural areas, mostly without any college education, gets sent to a foreign country where they live almost completely isolated from the local community. For a lot of them, this is their first time outside the US. They don't speak the language, they don't know the culture, and they can't communicate with people. They spend most of their time on the bases, which are like little self-contained American cities, complete with fast food joints, bowling alleys, golf courses, and swimming pools. They drive, but they don't need to take a Japanese road test. They fly in and out, but don't need to go through Japanese immigration. When they do go out into town, they go to bars and clubs that exist primarily to cater to them. Their interaction with locals is mostly through this lens, or with the few thousand locals who work on the bases and are thus dependent on the bases for their livelihood. After a few years of this kind of superficial interaction, they leave and are immediately replaced with a new wave of fresh faced young people. Of course, I'm generalizing, but this is the reality for most Americans down here. Would you really expect this kind of population to be your expert source on local affairs? It's like if a Chinese immigrant moved to NYC Chinatown, worked in a restaurant there, never learned English, and left after a few years. Would he really be an expert source on American history and politics?

So let's get on to the most obvious misconceptions. If I went through every single issue (economics, pollution and environmental issues, local history, crime rates and incidents, life under occupation, 1972 reversion, protest movements, Henoko construction) this would be a book. And there are already dozens of books on these issues. So I'll just cover a few of the more obvious problems. If you really want to know more about these things, I suggest you look into some of them. 

*****
1) ""Most anti-base protesters are paid"", ""most protesters are not even Okinawan and are from China/North Korea"", ""only a small vocal minority of Okinawans are anti-base"", ""anti-base protests are counterproductive and just a knee-jerk reaction""

Oh man. This is what happens when you mix total ignorance about history and politics with Alex Jones level conspiracy theories. Some quick history. Okinawa was occupied by the US from 1945-1972. The US wanted a forward position from which they could project power during the cold war (in simpler terms, a forward position from which to bomb Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). Some fortifications were left behind by the Japanese, but the US wanted a much larger military build-up, so they needed more land. This land was forcibly seized from locals. Those who resisted were arrested. 

Of course, Japan now pays rent for this land, but because the economy was mostly agrarian, thousands of people at the time were left homeless. These farmers started the first wave of anti-base protests during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1970s, sentiment was shifting against the Vietnam War both at home in America, and also in mainland Japan and in Okinawa. Planes were flying out daily from Okinawa to go on bombing runs in Vietnam, and the American military population swelled to 100,000. Locals here didn't want to be part of a war they had nothing to do with, and for Japan's newly pacifist society, the whole situation was seen as a political embarrassment. During the occupation years, locals had their own community police, and Americans had their own military police. If Americans committed crimes against locals, the locals had to report it to the American military police, who often didn't even speak Japanese. Even if crimes were reported, nothing was usually done, and there was no mechanism for redress. Obviously, given these circumstances, most crimes committed by Americans against locals went unreported, because why bother? For particularly embarrassing crimes such as serial robbery or murder, offending service members were just shipped off the island. All this came to a head with the Koza riots in 1972. American politicians, realizing the situation was out of control, came to an agreement with Japan to transfer Okinawa back to Japan, with the caveat that all the bases would remain indefinitely in Okinawa. Of course, Okinawans weren't consulted in the matter. The third wave of protests kicked off with the 1995 rape incident. A lot of people don't seem to understand this incident. The anger wasn't that the rape had occurred, per se, but the circumstances surrounding the rape. Because the 4 Americans had been talking beforehand, and allegedly other service members had heard them, it was hard to accept the ""one bad apple"" or ""crazy lone wolf"" argument. At least 4 service members, possibly more, knew of the plan and did nothing to stop it. The victim was a 12 year old schoolgirl walking home from the bookstore. The perpetrators had prepared a rental car and duct tape, and had spent several hours driving around looking for a suitable victim. Although the crime was immediately reported and local police knew who the perpetrators were, because they were safely on base, they weren't handed over to local police until a month had passed. Even after they were handed over, the perpetrators' families didn't apologize and instead blamed the locals, saying that it was their fault the rape happened because Japanese people are prejudiced against black people. While in prison, the perpetrators continued to write that going through the Japanese judicial system was a violation of their human rights. After their release, one of the perpetrators went back to the US, raped a college girl, killed her, and then committed suicide. 
Of course, rape happens. Many rape victims are raped by locals. The reason people were getting more and more pissed with each day that passed was because they didn't even know whether or not the perpetrators would even be brought out of base to face charges, justifiably because there had been so many cases in the past during occupation where perpetrators were never charged or were just quietly shipped off the island. 

Let's talk politics. The ""Okinawa problem"" or the ""base issue"" has been a major issue in Japanese politics for a long, long time. Yukio Hatoyama, Japan's Prime Minister from 2009-2010, resigned explicitly over the base issue. Local anti-base politicians consistently win a majority of positions in Okinawa. The previous governor lost his position because he switched from a anti-base position to a pro-base position. The current governor won a historic landslide victory on an anti-base position. Polls consistently show 75%-90% of locals support base reduction. It's clearly not a ""vocal minority.""

Let's talk about the ""paid Chinese protesters"" thing. The earliest source for this myth started when AFN (Armed Forces Network) started partnering with Channel Sakura, a Japanese ultra-nationalist station from the mainland, to spread this story. For those who don't know, far-right Japanese groups hate Koreans, Chinese, Okinawans, mixed races... basically, anyone who isn't pure-blood Japanese. They believe stuff like the emperor is literally divine, WW2 was a righteous struggle, or things like Nanking or other Japanese war crimes never happened. Think of them as Japan's version of neo-nazis. They organized a couple dozen people to cover their cars in North Korean and Chinese flags and drive around anti-base protests, and then worked with AFN to spread the story that most of the protesters are paid North Koreans or Chinese. Some sources: http://apjjf.org/-Jon-Mitchell/4819/article.html http://www.stripes.com/news/protests-on-okinawa-aren-t-always-what-they-appear-to-be-1.222240   

*****
2) ""Okinawa is poor, and the American military is keeping the economy afloat"" (or the more blunt ""Okinawans against bases are ungrateful freeloaders"")

Yes, Okinawa is the poorest of Japan's prefectures. However, expenses are much lower, so their standard of living is actually quite high. Why are expenses much lower? Okinawans have large extended families, mostly living in close proximity. A lot of people live in 3 generation homes (grandparents, parents, and kids). People often take care of each others' kids, and a lot of people use hand-me-down clothing or other items from relatives.
  
Most people belong to at least one social financing group, called ""moai"" groups. These groups started hundreds of years ago as community financing associations, but what it boils down to is a group of friends/coworkers/classmates getting together once a month or so for a party. Each member brings a fixed amount of money, usually between $100-$1000, and gives it to one person, and they rotate every time. Essentially, people are always giving and making interest free loans to each other, which keeps people out of financial emergencies and keeps social bonds tight.

Let's think about it another way. Let's pretend that Okinawans really are living in poverty. Poverty usually leads to bad things. Things like high crime, breakdown of social structures, and low life expectancy. However, Okinawa has one of the longest life expectancies in the world. It also has one of the lowest violent crime rates in the world. 

Let's get into economics. Military service members do some shopping in town. Of course, they do most of their shopping on base (the prices on base tend to be better for most things). They do frequent some bars, clubs, and restaurants. The bases employ a couple thousand locals. Including family members and contractors, we're talking some 50,000 people, or about 3-4% of the local population (around 1.4 million people). Japan also pays rent to the landowners whose land the bases are sitting on. According to Japan's government stats, the bases and related jobs make up around 4-5% of the local economy. So is this a positive? Absolutely, overwhelmingly, no. The bases are huge sprawling mini-cities that cover around 20% of the land, and around 33% of the prime, centrally located, non-mountainous land. Take a look at a map of the island. Because the bases are sprawling and cover the center of the island, people have to drive around them to get anywhere. A 10 minute straight drive suddenly becomes a 40 minute winding drive. Everything slows down. Think about what that does for efficiency. When base land is returned, the surrounding area usually makes between 10 times or 20 times as much money. These couple thousand base jobs come at a steep, steep cost for the other 1.4 million people.

Tourism revenue is increasing dramatically. Around 10 million tourists come every year, and it increases every year. Direct flights have opened up to Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Korea, and several other nearby countries. Okinawa is only 1 hour from Taipei, and 2 hours from Shanghai. Resort hotels run for a few hundred dollars a night. A nice dinner is between 50-100 dollars. Go to any of these places, and you won't see a single American face. It's all middle or upper class locals, domestic tourists from the mainland, and foreign tourists from Taiwan, China, or Korea. Meanwhile, the old American entertainment districts, Gate 2 street and BC street, which used to be booming in the 1970s, are now shuttering and closing their doors. Most of the girls who work these bars and clubs are now from Thailand or the Philippines, because locals have more opportunities and don't have to do that kind of work anymore.

Other major economic considerations: pollution. The bases are used to store munitions and chemical weapons. There are and have been leaks. When land is returned, the local government, not the US, has the responsibility to pay for clean-up. Noise. The bases are amazingly noisy. Tourists paying hundreds of dollars for a room generally don't like it when jets buzz their room at 2 in the morning, so tourist development is limited to very narrow areas.

I could keep going, but you get the picture. The situation here can't really be reduced to ""Okinawans stupid! Americans good!"" Personally, having lived here for a long time, I think there will always be some military presence here, or for as long as the US retains global dominance, which will probably be for a long time. The US needs/wants their global network of bases for power projection. 70 years ago, the ""threat"" was the USSR, then hot spots like Korea and Vietnam, and now the ""threat"" is China. There will always be some sort of ""threat"" in Asia. Japan wants US backing, considering only 20 years ago Japan's economy was by far the largest in Asia, a position that has been taken over by China. And the US wants Japan to act as a proxy in regional affairs. I don't see these things changing in the near future. But I think it's a tall order for locals to say ""yes, we're just a pawn in a game between great powers, let's just go home and take it then."" Maybe protesting is useless. Maybe voting is useless. Maybe no matter what people do, they'll be at the mercy of bigger, stronger forces. But I don't see why they shouldn't try. 
 
Locals aren't dumb, or protesting against themselves, or overly emotional. They have legitimate concerns. People are working, and have been working, on both sides, behind the scenes over the nitty gritty stuff. It's like Occupy Wall Street. People have legitimate concerns, like crazy student debt, influence of money in politics, etc. but it's easy for the media to interview some hippy looking dude who just says ""I want free stuff man!"" Same thing here. It's easy to sell a story interviewing someone who says ""Marines are rapists! Marines go home!"" Politics don't occur in a vacuum. Events happen, politicians respond. Orlando happens, the talking heads send out their tweets. Public opinion is only captured by shocking events. The reality is much more nuanced. ",Okinawan expat here. Here's the inside info on what's going on down here.,"Long-time Okinawa expat here. Been lurking reddit for years, getting tired of seeing misinformation every time Okinawa comes up, so here's a little rundown for those who are interested. 

Source: Living in Okinawa since 2004. American but no connection to the military. I teach at one of the local universities here. Living out here because my wife is local Okinawan and her family is here. She's a doctor here, I met her at a conference in Hawaii many years ago. Not big on debating politics, but it's annoying to see clear misinformation being spread around, hence this post. 
  
Rationale for posting: 99% of Americans that speak up on reddit about Okinawan issues are military related. Here's the thing - military related folk don't have an entirely unbiased view. Thought experiment: a group of mostly 18-25 year-old people, mostly from rural areas, mostly without any college education, gets sent to a foreign country where they live almost completely isolated from the local community. For a lot of them, this is their first time outside the US. They don't speak the language, they don't know the culture, and they can't communicate with people. They spend most of their time on the bases, which are like little self-contained American cities, complete with fast food joints, bowling alleys, golf courses, and swimming pools. They drive, but they don't need to take a Japanese road test. They fly in and out, but don't need to go through Japanese immigration. When they do go out into town, they go to bars and clubs that exist primarily to cater to them. Their interaction with locals is mostly through this lens, or with the few thousand locals who work on the bases and are thus dependent on the bases for their livelihood. After a few years of this kind of superficial interaction, they leave and are immediately replaced with a new wave of fresh faced young people. Of course, I'm generalizing, but this is the reality for most Americans down here. Would you really expect this kind of population to be your expert source on local affairs? It's like if a Chinese immigrant moved to NYC Chinatown, worked in a restaurant there, never learned English, and left after a few years. Would he really be an expert source on American history and politics?

So let's get on to the most obvious misconceptions. If I went through every single issue (economics, pollution and environmental issues, local history, crime rates and incidents, life under occupation, 1972 reversion, protest movements, Henoko construction) this would be a book. And there are already dozens of books on these issues. So I'll just cover a few of the more obvious problems. If you really want to know more about these things, I suggest you look into some of them. 

*****
1) ""Most anti-base protesters are paid"", ""most protesters are not even Okinawan and are from China/North Korea"", ""only a small vocal minority of Okinawans are anti-base"", ""anti-base protests are counterproductive and just a knee-jerk reaction""

Oh man. This is what happens when you mix total ignorance about history and politics with Alex Jones level conspiracy theories. Some quick history. Okinawa was occupied by the US from 1945-1972. The US wanted a forward position from which they could project power during the cold war (in simpler terms, a forward position from which to bomb Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). Some fortifications were left behind by the Japanese, but the US wanted a much larger military build-up, so they needed more land. This land was forcibly seized from locals. Those who resisted were arrested. 

Of course, Japan now pays rent for this land, but because the economy was mostly agrarian, thousands of people at the time were left homeless. These farmers started the first wave of anti-base protests during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1970s, sentiment was shifting against the Vietnam War both at home in America, and also in mainland Japan and in Okinawa. Planes were flying out daily from Okinawa to go on bombing runs in Vietnam, and the American military population swelled to 100,000. Locals here didn't want to be part of a war they had nothing to do with, and for Japan's newly pacifist society, the whole situation was seen as a political embarrassment. During the occupation years, locals had their own community police, and Americans had their own military police. If Americans committed crimes against locals, the locals had to report it to the American military police, who often didn't even speak Japanese. Even if crimes were reported, nothing was usually done, and there was no mechanism for redress. Obviously, given these circumstances, most crimes committed by Americans against locals went unreported, because why bother? For particularly embarrassing crimes such as serial robbery or murder, offending service members were just shipped off the island. All this came to a head with the Koza riots in 1972. American politicians, realizing the situation was out of control, came to an agreement with Japan to transfer Okinawa back to Japan, with the caveat that all the bases would remain indefinitely in Okinawa. Of course, Okinawans weren't consulted in the matter. The third wave of protests kicked off with the 1995 rape incident. A lot of people don't seem to understand this incident. The anger wasn't that the rape had occurred, per se, but the circumstances surrounding the rape. Because the 4 Americans had been talking beforehand, and allegedly other service members had heard them, it was hard to accept the ""one bad apple"" or ""crazy lone wolf"" argument. At least 4 service members, possibly more, knew of the plan and did nothing to stop it. The victim was a 12 year old schoolgirl walking home from the bookstore. The perpetrators had prepared a rental car and duct tape, and had spent several hours driving around looking for a suitable victim. Although the crime was immediately reported and local police knew who the perpetrators were, because they were safely on base, they weren't handed over to local police until a month had passed. Even after they were handed over, the perpetrators' families didn't apologize and instead blamed the locals, saying that it was their fault the rape happened because Japanese people are prejudiced against black people. While in prison, the perpetrators continued to write that going through the Japanese judicial system was a violation of their human rights. After their release, one of the perpetrators went back to the US, raped a college girl, killed her, and then committed suicide. 
Of course, rape happens. Many rape victims are raped by locals. The reason people were getting more and more pissed with each day that passed was because they didn't even know whether or not the perpetrators would even be brought out of base to face charges, justifiably because there had been so many cases in the past during occupation where perpetrators were never charged or were just quietly shipped off the island. 

Let's talk politics. The ""Okinawa problem"" or the ""base issue"" has been a major issue in Japanese politics for a long, long time. Yukio Hatoyama, Japan's Prime Minister from 2009-2010, resigned explicitly over the base issue. Local anti-base politicians consistently win a majority of positions in Okinawa. The previous governor lost his position because he switched from a anti-base position to a pro-base position. The current governor won a historic landslide victory on an anti-base position. Polls consistently show 75%-90% of locals support base reduction. It's clearly not a ""vocal minority.""

Let's talk about the ""paid Chinese protesters"" thing. The earliest source for this myth started when AFN (Armed Forces Network) started partnering with Channel Sakura, a Japanese ultra-nationalist station from the mainland, to spread this story. For those who don't know, far-right Japanese groups hate Koreans, Chinese, Okinawans, mixed races... basically, anyone who isn't pure-blood Japanese. They believe stuff like the emperor is literally divine, WW2 was a righteous struggle, or things like Nanking or other Japanese war crimes never happened. Think of them as Japan's version of neo-nazis. They organized a couple dozen people to cover their cars in North Korean and Chinese flags and drive around anti-base protests, and then worked with AFN to spread the story that most of the protesters are paid North Koreans or Chinese. Some sources: http://apjjf.org/-Jon-Mitchell/4819/article.html http://www.stripes.com/news/protests-on-okinawa-aren-t-always-what-they-appear-to-be-1.222240   

*****
2) ""Okinawa is poor, and the American military is keeping the economy afloat"" (or the more blunt ""Okinawans against bases are ungrateful freeloaders"")

Yes, Okinawa is the poorest of Japan's prefectures. However, expenses are much lower, so their standard of living is actually quite high. Why are expenses much lower? Okinawans have large extended families, mostly living in close proximity. A lot of people live in 3 generation homes (grandparents, parents, and kids). People often take care of each others' kids, and a lot of people use hand-me-down clothing or other items from relatives.
  
Most people belong to at least one social financing group, called ""moai"" groups. These groups started hundreds of years ago as community financing associations, but what it boils down to is a group of friends/coworkers/classmates getting together once a month or so for a party. Each member brings a fixed amount of money, usually between $100-$1000, and gives it to one person, and they rotate every time. Essentially, people are always giving and making interest free loans to each other, which keeps people out of financial emergencies and keeps social bonds tight.

Let's think about it another way. Let's pretend that Okinawans really are living in poverty. Poverty usually leads to bad things. Things like high crime, breakdown of social structures, and low life expectancy. However, Okinawa has one of the longest life expectancies in the world. It also has one of the lowest violent crime rates in the world. 

Let's get into economics. Military service members do some shopping in town. Of course, they do most of their shopping on base (the prices on base tend to be better for most things). They do frequent some bars, clubs, and restaurants. The bases employ a couple thousand locals. Including family members and contractors, we're talking some 50,000 people, or about 3-4% of the local population (around 1.4 million people). Japan also pays rent to the landowners whose land the bases are sitting on. According to Japan's government stats, the bases and related jobs make up around 4-5% of the local economy. So is this a positive? Absolutely, overwhelmingly, no. The bases are huge sprawling mini-cities that cover around 20% of the land, and around 33% of the prime, centrally located, non-mountainous land. Take a look at a map of the island. Because the bases are sprawling and cover the center of the island, people have to drive around them to get anywhere. A 10 minute straight drive suddenly becomes a 40 minute winding drive. Everything slows down. Think about what that does for efficiency. When base land is returned, the surrounding area usually makes between 10 times or 20 times as much money. These couple thousand base jobs come at a steep, steep cost for the other 1.4 million people.

Tourism revenue is increasing dramatically. Around 10 million tourists come every year, and it increases every year. Direct flights have opened up to Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Korea, and several other nearby countries. Okinawa is only 1 hour from Taipei, and 2 hours from Shanghai. Resort hotels run for a few hundred dollars a night. A nice dinner is between 50-100 dollars. Go to any of these places, and you won't see a single American face. It's all middle or upper class locals, domestic tourists from the mainland, and foreign tourists from Taiwan, China, or Korea. Meanwhile, the old American entertainment districts, Gate 2 street and BC street, which used to be booming in the 1970s, are now shuttering and closing their doors. Most of the girls who work these bars and clubs are now from Thailand or the Philippines, because locals have more opportunities and don't have to do that kind of work anymore.
